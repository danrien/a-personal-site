Hi! Thanks for visiting my little site about, well, me.

I'm a full-stack software engineer with 5 years of experience in the industry
developing everything from C# ASP.net applications to WinForms click-once applications
to maintaining and improving old Delphi applications.

On the side I pursue multiple hobby projects, including a site where you tell me
what kind of computer you want and I give you a [delicious recipe](http://deliciouspc.com)
to build it, to an audio playback application for Android that streams music from
your home PC (or server, if you have a dedicated one). You can learn more about
those on the [side projects](/projects) page. I guess you could say that I just
really love programming and learning about new (and old!) ways of doing things.

In that mold, this site itself was built using the extremely fun combination
of ReactJS and NodeJS (along with LessCSS for the highly sophisticated styling),
using statically rendered views on every page except for the [notes](/notes) page,
which implements a quick hacky infinite scroll thing that I threw together in a day,
and thus uses a combination of ReactJS rendered server-side and client-side.
You can view and fork all the gory details on GitHub.
