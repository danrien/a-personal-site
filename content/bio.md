Hi! Thanks for visiting my little site about, well, me.

I'm a software engineer with 5 years of experience in the industry developing everything
from C# ASP.net applications to WinForms click-once applications to maintaining
and improving old Delphi applications.

On the side I pursue multiple hobby projects, including a site for building your own
[computer](http://deliciouspc.com) to an audio playback application for Android
that streams music from your home PC (or server, if you have a dedicated one). You can learn
more about those on the [side projects](/projects) page. I guess you could say I'm
what is referred to as a "polyglot" programmer, but I just really love
programming and learning about new (and old!) ways of doing things.

In that mold, this site itself was built using the extremely awesome combination
of ReactJS and NodeJS (along with LessCSS for the highly sophisticated styling),
enabling static rendering on every page except for the [notes](/notes) page, which
implements a quick hacky infinite scroll thing that I threw together in a day. Of
course, you can view and fork all the gory details on GitHub.
