# Space Shuttle Launch

The launch of Space Shuttle STS-128 is [about to take place](http://www.space.com/spaceshuttle/index.html).  This is going to be a night time watch, and these things are always the coolest to watch.  Although day time ones are cool too. I highly recommend watching one of these if you never have.  I would like to see one live myself.
