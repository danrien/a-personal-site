# Starting up the development blog

So, I used to write... alot.  Truth be told, I had a lot more time on my hands.   I also had a lot of sad teenage/college experiences to talk about.  I'd like to think I've matured a bit since then, and also, since then, gained a bit of brain power (although a night at the bar's can erase that brain power a little bit).   Anyways, I plan to use this space to talk about software development, and the lessons I learn from it.  The main thrust of this blog will be, as it has been for quite some time, DeVeD Computers (name-change and new look coming soon, or at least within the next 30 years hopefully).   I am also thinking about starting up a resume page, for information about yours truly.
