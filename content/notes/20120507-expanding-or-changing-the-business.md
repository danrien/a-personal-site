# Expanding or changing the business...

So, now that I've had some free time, I've been thinking deeply about the business model I chose way-back-when I decided to open a boutique computer shop. Obviously, the market is not huge here, and to make a dent, I need to do something different than what I currently do. This puts a major roadblock in further developing my website... maybe. Or maybe not ;).... Either way, I've gone forward with CakePHP 1.3, and development has been easier than even I anticipated. Really slick framework for PHP.
