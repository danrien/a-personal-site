# New version of J. River Media Center Windows 7 Integration plug-in released

A new version of my Windows 7 integration plug-in for [J. River Media Center](http://www.jriver.com/index.html) has been released. Notable fixes include: 

  * Memory Leaked fixed on preview when Thumbnail Cover Art is enabled.
  * Thumbnail Cover Art properly re-sizes to thumbnail size.

It can be downloaded from the [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/j-river-media-center-windows-7-shell-integration/downloads/list) site I set-up for it.

I will detail the memory leak fix in greater detail a little bit later, as it was quite interesting... ![Windows 7 J. River Media Center Integration](http://machine.devedcomputers.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/progressbar-300x187.png)
