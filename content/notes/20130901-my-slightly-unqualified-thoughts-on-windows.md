# My (slightly (un)qualified) thoughts on Windows

In the court of public opinion, the jury has ruled on Windows 8. It has become clear that the drastic changes in UI without any instruction to the user or any way to change it back has had a negative effect in the uptake of Windows 8. And after I installed [Start8](http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/) and [Modern Mix](http://www.stardock.com/products/modernmix/) it has finally become clear to me that either Microsoft has plans that we aren't aware of yet or it has completely missed some massive potential here. If you aren't aware, Start8 restores the Windows start menu. It uses an icon that is similar to the icon from the restored Start button in Windows 8.1. Modern Mix is unique in that it adds the ability to run the Modern UI apps in a Window. This effectively restores Windows 8 to a Windows 7-like desktop UI. Surprisingly, it all works really well - and more than anything, it actually makes me want to _start using_ Windows 8 on my laptop. Modern Mix makes those beautiful <del>Metro</del> Modern UI apps usable without having to mess with the start screen, and with the ability to quickly switch to my normal Windows apps using my normal workflow. This tells me that at least I personally would have loved my purchase of Windows 8 if the following things had been done: When in laptop mode (i.e. with a keyboard/mouse): 

  1. The Windows  7 start menu, in the style of Windows 8 (or even a slightly improved one)
  2. No "start screen"
  3. No "charms"
  4. The ability to use Modern UI apps on the desktop
When in a "tablet mode" (i.e. no keyboard/mouse), enabling all the UI changes that Microsoft introduced with Windows 8 are fine, and even great. On top of this, to add on some nice-to-haves, when using my software on a Theater PC, I think these things would be nice: 
  1. The start button on an MCE remote should bring up the Start screen (yes now I like it)
  2. Metro apps should have an easy ability to tie-in with and use an MCE remote
On a side note, the Start screen actually works really well with the MCE remote once it is started, and [adding a registry change to map the Start Screen to the Start button](http://thedigitalmediazone.com/2012/07/25/remap-green-button-as-start-button-on-remote/) is not as hard as it sounds.
