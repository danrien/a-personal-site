# Version 0.9.4 of Windows 7/8 J. River Integration Media Center Plug-in

After a long wait, a new version of the Media Center plug-in is out! [It can be downloaded here](https://code.google.com/p/j-river-media-center-windows-7-shell-integration/downloads/list) and as you can see, I've added basic Jumplist support for Playlists:   ![Playlist Jumplist](http://davidvedvick.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mc_aero_jumplist.png)   ![Added configuration for adding playlists to jumplist](http://davidvedvick.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/mc_config-1024x506.jpg)   Here's the official changelist: New: 

  * Playlists can be pinned in the jumplist
Bug fixes: 
  * Config reverts upon installing a new version of Media Center
  * Window Title text in preview will not truncate to "J River Media Ce" (Thanks [StFeder](http://yabb.jriver.com/interact/index.php?topic=83236.msg568489#msg568489) from the J River forums)
As this a new release, I am not yet removing the 0.9.3 version until any stability issues are sorted out. [Download link.](https://code.google.com/p/j-river-media-center-windows-7-shell-integration/downloads/list)
