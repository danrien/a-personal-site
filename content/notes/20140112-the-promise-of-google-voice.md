# The Promise of Google Voice

I have just recently decided to drop my phone contract. I'm not dropping a contract completely - I'm making the incredibly tempting switch to T-Mobile's no annual contract, which won't include an ETF that will kill me if I decide to switch again. However, I hit one major snag while making this switch. I couldn't use my old North Dakota number as T-Mobile doesn't have 1st-party coverage in Bismarck, ND yet. My alternative would have been to go with AT&T or with their MVNO, AIO wireless, [which offers comparable plans to T-Mobile](http://www.aiowireless.com/home.html). However, I'm still fairly apprehensive of AT&T and their death-throe [business tactics](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/01/att-plan-to-turn-data-caps-into-more-cash-could-come-to-home-internet/). In the end, I chose T-Mobile. So how does this play into Google Voice? My solution ended being that I would use T-Mobile, but use Google voice as my number. The potential of this solution is amazing: without a number that is tied to a phone service or contract, but rather just to _me_, I'm able to easily pick up a prepaid SIM from AT&T when I need some minutes in North Dakota, and just assign the number with the SIM to my Google voice account. I really hope that as Google starts to move more out of working on building the structure for an open handset into providing the services on that handset that they come back to Google Voice and really start to sell this potential to customers.
