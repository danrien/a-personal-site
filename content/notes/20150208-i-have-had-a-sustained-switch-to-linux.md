# I have had a sustained switch to Linux

After many years of fits and starts, I have finally stayed on a Linux distro for many months. What conditions enabled this change? 

  * I spend much more of my time just programming these days when I'm on my PC than doing entertainment tasks (i.e. watching movies, playing games) 
    * Except for Visual Studio, many of the same tools I use for programming are available on Linux
  * Steam was made available for Linux, and most importantly, Civ 5 was ported to Linux, so when I _do_ game, I can play the game I like playing most on my PC
  * Linux Mint came out with a, shall we say, "normal" or perhaps "traditional" user interface, and is rock solid
  * As a bonus, the Media player program I've used for years, [has come out with a Linux port that's in development](http://yabb.jriver.com/interact/index.php?board=35.0)
  * The open source driver for AMD cards has really grown into its own
Overall, I'm loving it!
