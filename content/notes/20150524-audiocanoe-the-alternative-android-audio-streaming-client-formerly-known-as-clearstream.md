# "audiocanoe" - the alternative JRiver Media Center audio streaming client for Android formerly known as Clearstream

"audiocanoe", the alternative JRiver Media Center audio streaming client for
Android, formerly known as "Clearstream", has been updated. The biggest update in
this release is an improved "File details" view:

An update: If you prefer downloading and installing from Google Play, along with
all the benefits that provides, you can join the "beta" as it were by joining
[this Google+ group](https://plus.google.com/communities/116136407897208577626.)
(annoying, I know, I think if/as soon as I decide to promote it to production,
I'm going to disband the beta group). You can also try this
[direct link to the play store](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.lasthopesoftware.bluewater),
 but I think it's going to ask you to join the group first.
