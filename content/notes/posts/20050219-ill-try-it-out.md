# I'll Try it Out

Hey guys. I guess I'm going to try out this blog deal. Of course, a blog stands for weB LOG. It's sort of a thing thats catching on these days with all the kids so i figured why not. I think blogs are interesting in the way that watching commentators on FOX News is interesting. It allows others to read your take on the world around you, your opinion of whats happening and what not. In a sense, this relates directly to my english class at the moment: i just finished writing a paper last week that focused on commentaries. To emphasize that, I would like to point out its massive use during the recent presidential elections. During the elections, various blogs that were funded by the parties were setup where people would state their heavily partisan influenced opinions. Consequently, congress is considering passing a bill that would limit how those sort of things would be funded and used during election periods. Anyways, now that I've done my first blog and pointed out my genius, I'm going to go and be stupid again. PEACE.
