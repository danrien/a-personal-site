# Mid-day posting

Man this is fun. Getting to bs about my life. Anyways, today I didnt really plan on doing too much. I guess I planned on doing phsyics and that's still the one thing I haven't done yet, but oh well. What I did do today was set up the surround sound speakers for my family. They are pretty technologically illiterate and so I have to do alot of this stuff. I wish I could just show them how to do it and they'd remember it, but people don't really seem to remember how to do stuff unless they learn it themselves. Why did I have to setup the speakers?? Well we got this sweet new fireplace put in downstairs and so everything had to be rearranged in some sick fashion that makes me wanna hurl. I couldn't figure out what to do with the rear speakers since my mother insists on no cords (how is that possible?). But I figured out that if I put it under the little brick overhang they wouldn't show that bad. Apparently that wasn't good enough for my mom. Whatever. Then I had to go help my good friend reinstall Windows XP. That wasn't too bad but it was a little tough explaining to his parents where I got the cd from (cough cough), which I of course purchased legally. At any rate I'm going to go eat now and hopefully get my shirt back tonite that I left with my friend last night. I'll tell that story later. PEACe
