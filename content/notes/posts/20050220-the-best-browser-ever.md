# The Best Browser Ever

Hey guys I was just thinking of this and since this is kind of my singular voice to the world I thought I would try to help spread a really cool thing thats been happening. It kind of starts out like this. EVERYONE uses Internet Explorer. Everyone knows what that little blue e is it can't be mistaken. Well as you all should know by now internet explorer is filled with security holes. Many of you probably have spyware running on top of it, have viruses exploiting it, etc. Well it turns out that a group of nerds have gotten together to create the next big browser. They aren't selling it, they aren't packaging it with other things, they're just making it to better the internet experience. It's really great, it blocks pop ups (thank god), and if there are security holes they're fixed much sooner because it's a bunch of guys who just want a nice, clean good browser. This isn't the "I don't care about you" browser from microsoft. This browser is called FireFox, I've been using for quite awhile now and I highly recommend it. To say it like they say it in commercials "Get it at firefox.org" PEACE OUT *EDIT* So I lied. It's not firefox.org, its actually more complicated than that. The real address is: "http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/" Sorry guys and girls.
