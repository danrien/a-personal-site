# Afternoon Delight

Tonite has been pretty cool. A few old friends got a hotel witha jacuzzi for 45 bucks and so i stopped by there and checked that out. I was going to swim but I unfortunately showed up like 10 minutes too late. I think its pretty uncalled for that they would close the pool at 11:00, that's pretty much the worst idea I've EVER heard. Then I went to this party with my best friend and we watched this really drunk guy give some awesome speaches. It was pretty hilarious. I was supposed to say hi to a friend from this girl, but that didn't pan out. Then I went and played the sequel to Champions of Norrath over at the Bradleys and played that till my mind was numb with pressing those little green a buttons on those ugly xbox controllers. Anyways nothing too exciting. Just a good last night in B-Town with the buds. PEACE
