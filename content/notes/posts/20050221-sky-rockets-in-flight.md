# Sky Rockets in Flight

Finally back to college. Well I guess I shouldn't really say finally, it was only 2 and a half days back in the Biso. Unfortunately it seems that ever since I went home I've been really tired. Some people worry that lots of sleep might mean I have mono, which I would hope isn't true. As far as I can remember, I haven't kissed anyone (well maybe one but we just wont worry about that) in the past 18 years so I definitely wouldn't get it that way. Possibly I just drank something that my friend (who had mono) drank, which could definitely give me mono. I dont know I think I'll ride it out for a while and see what happens and if it gets worse I'll prolly check out the doctor. I'm guessing and hoping that I was just really worn out from last week. Apart from my apparent sickness, I finally got my shirt back. I lost my shirt when I changed into a BSC Rat Pack shirt and threw it in my friends car. BSC is a community college in my hometown and the teams aren't the greatest, good but not great. Ripping apart other teams like that has to be the most enjoyable thing ever, especially since at times we can be inches away from the other teams faces. Really brings a whole new element to being rowdy at a game. One other good thing came out of getting my shirt back, I also got my Hawaii Surf Company cap back that I left at that kid's house ages ago. What are the odds?! ANyways, sorry for no deep subjects, I'm really burned out from physics and I just don't really feel like deep thinking tonite. Talk to ya guy(s) tomorrow. PEACe
