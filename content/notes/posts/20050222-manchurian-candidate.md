# Manchurian Candidate

Hey. I just watched the Manchurian Candidate and I thought I would do a little review on it. In some movies, it's evident that the movie is try to get a point across. It's trying to teach a moral to the story, basically. The problem with this movie is that it seems like it's trying to say something but it just doesn't know what. Sadly, the movie is definitely too Hollywood-ized. A first grader could understand the plot in this one. Sometimes this is good, but when a movie tries to be intelligent, I don't necesarrily want an easy plot. I want one that makes me wrap my head around it. One that makes me try to understand it. However, I'm not going to say the movie is bad. It defintely has its interesting ideas (although they're ideas we've all probably thought of), and it has its interesting moments. It's worth a watch, maybe a second viewing, but in no way was I impressed by it. PEACE out
