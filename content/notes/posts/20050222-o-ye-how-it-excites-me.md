# O ye how it excites me

I had an interesting observation to make that I thought I would throw out there. While I was drinking caffeine to stay awake earlier this afternoon, I realized that this damn drink was doing nothing for me. It might keep me awake, but it hardly keeps me aware. Even though I failed to fall asleep after I decided the caffeine was doing nothing, I stayed awake. However I still felt just as shitty and tired as I did before I layed down and yet I still couldn't fall asleep. So why do we drink this damn drink? While I was laying in bed I also thought of something else but I totally forgot about it (like usual). Perhaps if it comes back to me I'll write it down, but if not what the hell. LOL I was just going to say keep it real to you guys and I just thought about how my mom told me to keep it real before going back to college. Don't you just love it when your parents struggle to stay hip with their kids? Keep it real.
