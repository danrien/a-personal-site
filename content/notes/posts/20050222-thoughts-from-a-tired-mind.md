# Thoughts from a tired mind

First day back at school.... Dear god physics was long as all hell (isn't that wrong using god and hell in the same sentence?). Have you ever noticed that it's really hard to write while other people are in the room, or looking over your shoulder?? I would say it's one of the hardest things ever. Phew my roommates gone. Anyways Physics. So I pretty much zoned out the whole class and didn't pay attention at all, my mind just didn't feel like cooperating. At least I'm done with school. Something else I wanna bring up is this little deal on MSN that lets you blog now. While I was inspired by other people who have started doing that, I decided to use blogger because A. It's run by google; and B. It's not run by microsoft. I encourage everyone else to use blogger as well, it's super easy to use and they're not trying to make a quick profit off of your own personal desires. I mean really, why give Microsoft extra money? At any rate, everyone who does read this, you rock, keep it real, etc. etc. PEA cE
