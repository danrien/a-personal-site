# I dreamt a dream while dreaming

Hey guys. Just woke up from my early mornining siesta and I have to say I had a wacky dream. Not so much in the dream itself, but in the clues I had that I indicated I was dreaming. For one, there was this song that kept on plaing in the background that went like "I am a dreamweaver I am a dreamweaver" on repeat to like an old 50's song tune. Then it seemed like I just couldn't keep my eyes open. Like I was having a totally normal conversation with my dad about a vacuum cleaner that automatically finds its own plugin, but my eyes just couldn't stay open. In addition, whenever my eyes wanted to close I just wanted to sleep. How weird. Anyways, I'm off to Physics. See ya
