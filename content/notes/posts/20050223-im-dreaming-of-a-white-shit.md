# I'm Dreaming of a White.... Shit.

Hey I figured that while I'm burning some DVD's I would make a little post on here. I put my status as "Out to Lunch" on my MSN, so I don't have to talk to any annoying girls like Mandi.... :p Just kidding. But not really. (Props to room 311 for that one!) Anyways, seriously I am pretty tired so I just thought I would make a post to keep my audience of like 2 entertained. Currently my roommate is studying for an Econ test and I keep on annoying him to see what he'll do. There's my plug for Evan. Anyways, I've customized my blog a bit.... I've added some links (I had to code it in by hand) to other friend's blogs to the lower right hand corner, since none of them use Blogger and make it easy on me. Also, I've made it possible for anybody to leave comments, so feel free to go at it and make fun of me and say mean things and stuff.... just remember the whole world's holding you accountable!! Ahem. PEACE
