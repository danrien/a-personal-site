# Phew

Well there's good news. I don't have mono!! Good thing mom's not always right ;). They did some blood tests on me and all the good stuff and overall I bet I spent around an hour and a half at the Wellness Center. And I can also hear alot better now! Won't go into that though. Anyways, keep it safe people.
