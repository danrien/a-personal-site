# The past is beautiful like the darkness between the fireflies

Whats up guys. The lyric above is from a song by Mason Jennings. Coincidentally, it's called "The Darkness Between the Fireflies". I highly recommend downlo-- ahem buying the cd. Anyways, last night while I was under the influence of tiredness, I forgot to explain my name. Anyone who goes to college up here would understand though.... we just happened to get like an inch and a half of snow in one night and it pretty much sucks, since I hate snow. However, one good thing did come of it. The best part of snow is how beautiful it is when it's falling down in big white snow flakes. Now don't go ahead and start dissing me for saying falling snow is beautiful, I am very in touch with my masculinity and just because I think nature has such a potential to be pretty doesn't mean I'm a femme. In fact that brings me to an interesting observation about nature. I'm sure everyone's read some of those nature poems in English before, but you never really think about it until you experience it. In all reality, nature has such a potential to be so beautiful or ugly. Nature takes so many shapes and is so intertwined (or used to be) with our survival, sometimes it's hard not to take it all in and just enjoy it for what it is. Sadly, one day I don't see much of nature surviving. While I have no doubt mankind can exist without it now (hell, we grow genetically engineered plants everywhere these days), if not definitely in the future, that's not to say I will miss what it does for us. We don't necessarily need it, but it reminds us who we are, where we came from and why we're here. Without this crucial teaching lesson in front of our eyes all the time, I just hate to wonder what the world will one day be like. Best we can do is hope for the best I guess. Anyways, don't get too depressed. We can do lots to help nature and who knows what humanity will turn out like. Anyways, have a good day everybody, PEACE OUT.

**[Anonymous](#6 "2005-02-25 01:37:00"):** Nature, or the material world, will survive with or without **us**. Also, there's nothing wrong with being a femme. As I recall, Paul Maud'dib was part femme.
