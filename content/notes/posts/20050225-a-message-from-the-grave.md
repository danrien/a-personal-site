# A message from the Grave....

Hey guys. Pretty dead tired this evening. Overall, I've had a pretty busy day. I started out with calc at 8 in the damn morning and relearned all about trig inverse derivatives and other good stuff with derivatives. Last time we learned about the chain rule and so thats cool. For those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, suffice to say a derivative is basically a more complex form of slope of a line. At 1, I had my Digital Systems test. Digital Systems mainly focuses on "Boolean Algebra", basically a form of math that deals only with true/false statements, or in the world of microprocessors, on or off, 1 or 0. Fun stuff :D. Then I went and worked out with the beautiful, engaging Mandi and just about killed myself on the bikes. Today I realized it's probably not the best idea to burn 340 calories when your body is being racked by some viral attack. After that, I showered and went to Intro to Computers, ECE 173. Now for those of you who have taken Intro to Computing or whatever they call it in the generals, this is far from the basics of computers. It should actually be called Intro to High-Level Languages or something because it deals mostly with C++, a certain way to write code for computers. So now I'm going to take a nap (hopefully) and then hit up some anime with my buds Paul Maud'dib (there Anonymous poster) and Simon. YES I'M A GEEK I'LL ADMIT IT DAMNIT. Oh and by the way, if my memory serves me right, Paul Maud'dib was far from a femme. Although he was aware of the female perspective of things and was able to intimately understand the mentality of a female (as well as his ability to remember what all the females in his lineage had experienced), he was still very much the man. In fact, he was a prototype of what we all look for in a leader: very understanding, had very good long term planning (he could see into the future), and most of all he had the reckless masculinity we associate with leadership. I mean, look at Bush, all he has is one of those and he's president. For those of you wondering who Paul Maud'dib is, he's a very complex character from a book called Dune, who even I admittedly don't completely understand. Unfortunately I never really saw feminine characteristics in him, but if Mr. Anonymous did, then that's fine. But once again I'm letting my nerdish tendencies leak into my writing. Anyways, everybody keep it real, have a good weekend, and most of all don't get too drunk. And if you do, call me I'll grab the keys and drive you home. PEACE OUT.

**[Mr. Anonymous](#8 "2005-03-04 11:30:00"):** You understand what I'm saying. He can look from many different perspectives and was trainined in both the female and male ways. He had combat and leadership training from his gaurds and father, and he had Bene-Gesserit (spelling) training from his mother.
