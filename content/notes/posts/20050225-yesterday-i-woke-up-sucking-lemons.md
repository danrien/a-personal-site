# Yesterday I woke up sucking lemons

Hey guys. I'm booooorrreeed. So I thought I would make a quick post. I'm not going to be very deep this time, I dont like to think all the time you know. I think that this blog might be a bit of a shock to some people, people who didn't necessarily know that I thought about these kinds of things. If you happen to be one of those people, you should know that I go into these moods normally when I'm alone or when you see me looking off into space. Anyways, don't think like this kind of stuff is all I think about. I probably actually think about girls more than I do about all this kind of stuff, I guess it just gets boring for me too. But I had to empty some of it out of my brains and so I did. It sure was a relief. Keeping heavy shit like nature and whatnot bottled up in your brain can really be a pain sometimes and I feel that everyone should feel free to let go their thoughts too when they feel the burden. So, that's about it. PEACe
