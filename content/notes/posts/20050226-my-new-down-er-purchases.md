# My new down--- er purchases

Hey guys. Got 2 new CDs last night. Won't go in-depth into how I got them, but suffice to say my pocketbook is still at the same size. Anyways, the first CD I got was the new Stereophonics CD "Language Sex Violence Other?", and so far it seems really solid. The second was the new Jack Johnson CD "In Between Dreams" which also seems really good. So many good CDs being released these days. When they come out, I highly recommend purchasing them. Definitely worth the money. But what I'm really stoked about in the music world is Weezer's new CD. Finally, it's pretty much completed and they're making the first music video for it. If you happen to be in SoCal and are one of the lucky people to show up as an extra in the shoot for the video, just know that I and a million other Weez fans envy you hardcore. ANyways, that's WHats happening in my musical wworld! Out
