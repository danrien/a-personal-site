# Tiptoe round... tie them down

Hey I found this pretty good (opinionated) article on the falling value on our dollar. I just remember the good ol days in the Clinton presidency when our dollar was valued really high. Now, all my Republican friends, don't go arguing with me. I'm not saying that it's necessarily all of Bush's fault, but he certainly his administration certainly has been borrowing loads of money, which is never good. There's a reason I hate credit cards and it's because you don't know when to stop. The same goes for borrowing from other countries too. Anyways, here's the [link](http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/0,1518,343449,00.html). See ya guys.
