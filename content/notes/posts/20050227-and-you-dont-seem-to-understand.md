# And you don't seem to understand

Last night was amazingly fun. It all started out with the SDSU vs. NDSU b-ball game, where we kicked some ass. Actually our team got their ass kicked but me and 5 of my buddies just rocked the crowd. Every single word I said at that I can't repeat here, so suffice to say it was crazy. After the game I drove like 3 girls and a guy to the SAE frat where they were supposedly have a party. Well the party wasn't really happenin so I managed to somehow corral all the kids back into the car and we went over to a friend's house and partied it up over there. Some crazy shit happened over there that I won't really go into, but overall it was really fun. It took till about 4 in the morning though to get them all back together again and drive them home. So overall it was a really good night. I have to say that right now, being sober every weekend isn't so bad. I'm enjoying making fun of the drunks and it really is a good time. We'll see what spring break has to say about that but until then I should be fine. Well, when I feel like writing more I'll get back to you guys. Keep it real and happenin.
