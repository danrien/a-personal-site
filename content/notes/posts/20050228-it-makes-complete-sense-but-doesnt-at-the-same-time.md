# It makes complete sense but doesn't at the same time

Hey guys. I watched an awesome movie last night, called "I HEART Huckabees." I won't give anything away, but it is hilarious, if you figure out the running joke through the whole movie. I suddenly see the whole world, but I don't. So I found out yesterday about this clause in the whole Lent deal. Apparently, on Sundays you "take a break" from Lent and are able to take part in what you gave up. This dissapoints me extremely because that means I could've been drinking every saturday night (or sunday morning if you get me ;)). However that doesn't mean it doesn't bother me. It just seems ridiculous that people make these "sacrifices" for God and then they just blow it off on Sundays, the day of the Lord. Whatever, I'm not the most hardcore Catholic or even Christian out there (I hardly ever go to Church :D), but still this stupid little allowance is just dumb. Oh well. Maybe next year I'll start Lent a week later and then give it up for 40 days straight. And on that note, see ya guys later!
