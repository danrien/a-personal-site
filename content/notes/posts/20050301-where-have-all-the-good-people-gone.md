# "Where have all the good people gone?"

"To long a parasite and you cannot exist without a host." â€” _God Emperor of Dune_ I'm quote heavy tonight. Turns out I was listening to Jack Johnson while reading _God Emperor of Dune_, so what can I do? What I've really been missing from my life is a good lover. LOL just kidding. But not really. But seriously, it's been my harddrive mp3 player. I miss that thing like I would miss a lover if I had one. In fact, it probably was my lover. What happened to it? Why it broke. You see a harddrive mp3 player, while having the advantage of a large capacity (I had about 4300 songs on it and it was only 2/3 full), have the unfortunate disadvantage of having disks. A harddrive is nothing more than a different form of the old spinning disk, minus the lasers and needles etc. Instead it uses powerful electrically charged magnets to change the charges of tiny portions of other magnets. Hope I got that right :S. Anyways, these disks are very prone to breaking (even though they have a new technology that shuts of hd's when they fall at a certain speed) and wearing down, so it's only a matter of time before they bust. And so this happened to mine :'(. Isn't it funny how we get so attached to stupid mechanical devices? When my cellphone busted, I just about died. I think I might have cried one night in my sleep. I had nightmares about what people were doing about it. Ugghh.. PEACE That last two sentences were total absolute lies.
