# I've been changing channels I don't see them on the TV Shows

Give it up for JJ again. Anyways. Turns out I didn't get the RA job :(. However, I did get into the "pool" which is where i always seem to be. I just can't avoid that crack. haha. Anyways, being in the pool means that I'm guaranteed a job at one point, there were just not enough open positions now to give me a job. Oh well. Guess that means I'm going to move into an apartment with my roommate Evan and party it up there. Which will also mean I'm going to need some mula. WELL it turns out I can put this little ad on my site from google that gives me a little money. All it does is it finds relevant information in what I write and then it puts out a little text message/advertisement wherever I choose on the page. I then get paid per click or maybe even just for views on the ad or something. Anyways, I think I'm going to try this out and see what you guys think. But before I go through with it, you guys should post some comments or questions on this idea.
