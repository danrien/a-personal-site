# I like sandwiches

It's my birthday today. I got this sweet new wireless keyboard and mouse. The mouse is extremely sensitive and quick and just really nice. The keyboard has that nice touch to it and the nice brand new feel. I also got the Weezer "Green Album" (because it's green) CD and the Snow Patrol CD The Final Straw. Both awesome CD's. I also finished out my collection of Lord of the Rings DVDs with finally getting the first, Fellowship of the Ring. Anyways lifes good and relaxed right now. A little drama and what not but when isn't that happening? Oh well it's a good time. PEACE
