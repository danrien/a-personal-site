# My research essay so far.

Hey guys. Just a quick post tonite. It's my english research paper. Read it if you want, if not whatever. Leave comments on it if u want too. 

Privatizing Social Security

The year is 2050. You and your spouse have finally gotten to the golden age of retirement, assuming your 18 now. For awhile, you've been making the preparations to start collecting your social security. Unfortunately, your college degree didn't really pan out and so you ended up working a job that earned you about thirty thousand a year, same for your wife.

Both of you voted for George Bush way back 2004 because you felt that his plan for privatized social security was a good idea. After all, investing in the market always gives good returns, right? And didn't those politicians say that the market returns more money?

Wake up. The stock market has crashed. Politicians are on the news talking about how they are going to go about funding privatized social security accounts. They might have to draw into the budget, unless they forgo paying social security at all (which would otherwise be known as political suicide).

So what happened to _Social Security, _you ask yourself. In particular, what happened to the _Social _part and the _Security_ part? Turns out is was thrown away when the 2005 congress decided to go ahead with Privatizing Social Security.

The scenario above is all to realistic if our congress decides to go ahead with Bush's proposal. While no one really believes that the fairly stable stock market will fully crash, the risk is present and very real. While many Americans have now learned about the consequences of implementing such a plan, this essay's main purpose is to examine the positive and negative aspects of either plan: private or social pensions.

In the book _Fiscal Policy_, Laurence J. Kotlikoff examines many of the aspects of privatizing social security. He examines another country who's social security is privatized, Chile. In doing such, he finds that their system offers no benefits over the previous system; in fact , when Chile decided to go ahead with privatization, they actually had to borrow money from their surplus budget to make the transition.

However, he found that it benefited the population in that they were able to know how much they were receiving back as pension. Because of the complexities of social security as it is, he says it is nearly impossible to know how much money one will receive from the government when he retires. With a private system, he supposes that it would be easier to keep track of the growth of the pension fund.

He also extrapolates that if the system were to give out earnings on the fund by directly returning the fund plus interest earned, people would (according to most predictions) earn back more than they would under social security. Also, he says it would be more equal, since people who would earn a lot early in life would receive just as much or more than those who earned more later in life. In addition, a two-earner couple would receive just as much as a single-earner couple; in our current system, a single-earner couple receives quite a bit more back than a two-earner couple, due to the fact that the two-earner is supposed to make more money over the years than the single-earner couple.
