# Ooo the irony

So I've been thinking about joining this Facebook thing lately. It seems like all the cool kids do it these days so I figured I should definitely get into it and I try to be cool again. Oh wait, probably still won't work ;). That's cool though. I love being who I am, and truthfully I have all the right friends. But really I've found it kind of shocking how all the people these days are really starting to migrate their lives partially to the online world. Kind of makes me think of Lain.... if you don't know what that is, then don't ask, explaining would kill me. It almost makes me wonder where us nerds are going to move next. I mean sure some nerds will remain in the current state, there's always the "conservative" nerds who stick with their card games and Dungeons and Dragons, and just as that happens, I am sure some will stick with the MMOs and Blogs of today. But the "progressive" nerds are the ones to watch: they like to stay ahead of the curve and pave the way for the cool people. I really just have to wonder what they'll think of next. Maybe online 3-d Avatars (that don't have to with an MMO)? Anyhow, I dont want any to think that I'm slamming them for being popular or anything. Some people have the charisma to draw others and blah blah blah and that's all cool. But to those who are joining facebook to prove to others that they have more friends or something like that, trust me it isn't going to help you. Join it to stay in touch with your friends and for the enjoyment of that. Remember, the friends that don't care about who's on your facebook are probably the friends worth keeping. Out.
