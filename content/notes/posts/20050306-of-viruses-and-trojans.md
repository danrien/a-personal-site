# Of viruses and trojans

Hey guys. I've heard about a new virus going around the intranets (my roommate got it) and I have to warn you: when someone hasn't been talking to u at all then out of nowhere they just send you some random file, don't click on it, no matter how funny the sendee says it is. First ask them "what is this?" If they don't reply, or they don't know what you're talking about, dont accept. It's just common sense, no offense to those who have accepted it. But really, use some caution on this world wide webber. Anyways, if you happened to accept, go to the website "www.grisoft.com" and download the free virus scanner there (it's under downloads->products) and scan it up and make sure that shit's gone. Anyhow, hope that helps guys. PEACE
