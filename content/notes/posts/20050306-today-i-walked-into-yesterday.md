# Today I walked into yesterday

Hey how's that for a song lyric? Think I might use it in one of my shit songs. Anyways, the reason why I thought of that was because of my experiences yesterday. I was so frustrated, I had to rant to like 10 different people 30 or so times. What could happen? Well, first my family could come up the day I was going to leave and watch state swimming. Then, after they kindly feed me and offer to jump my car (my car has a tendency to be dead), I find out I have a flat tire! And before we could put the spare on, we had to fill it up because that was flat too! Well, as my car isn't standard at all, the jack for lifting the car had to be placed under a certain position, not even an axle! Me and my faja worried about that for like a half hour at least. So I spent about all day doing that, then we went to Sears and had them put brand new front tires on. Now, it drives like a beauty. So in some ways, I'm happy that I was able to do that, but I'm also disappointed I didn't get to see some of my best friends. :'( Anyway, I'm going to go to church today! :O Haha Peace in the middle east
