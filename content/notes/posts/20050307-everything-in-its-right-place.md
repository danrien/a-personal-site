# Everything in its right place

Playing now: 'Everything In It's Right Place' by 'Radiohead' from 'Kid A' on Media Center 10.0 Hey guys, whats up. I just got done doing the workout thing. I kind of got screwed over. There were like half a billion people there, which is half the population of ndsu pretty much, so as you can imagine there were only like 3 machines open out of the 400 billion or so available machines. Anyway, I meant to stop by my friends' places in weible, the girls dorm tonite because they had "amnesty" night, where they let us creepy guys wander around for 3 hours unattended for the whole year. Believe me, that makes it good enough for the whole year. Anyway, like I said, I was going to stop by, but they shut the doors on me just as I came up to them, so as usual I was just that little bit late. Oh well, wasn't meant to be I guess. Hey I'd like to put out a thanks to those who read this, you know who you are coz I sure as hell don't. The only people I know who occasionally read this site our my cousin Cody, Paul Maud'dib, Mandi o Mandi, and possibly CARrie (not sure on the last one0. Thanks guys and girls.
