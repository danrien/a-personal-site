# Coz if we hold on we could find some new energy

Now Playing: 'Year Of The Rat' by 'Badly Drawn Boy' from 'One Plus One Is One' on Media Center 10.0 Hey. Have you ever listened to Badly Drawn Boy? He's good. Very good. So good it makes me wanna cry. Well maybe not that good. But he does make me very happy and pleased with life. So I'm thinking I should start greasing my hair back like all the cool people do. Or maybe not. I dont know. I just worked out and I kind of have that same buzz going on I might have talked about last night. I can't really remember. But let me tell you it's awesome. I've been doing this crazy thing in the gym lately that I learned from swimming. At the morning practices we'd always do this crazy thing where we'd run a couple laps around both the basketball courts and then do like 20 or 25 push-ups. Yeah we'd do that like 10 to 15 times. It was awesome. WHY ARE BRUNETTES SO GORGEOUS??? Anyways I've kind of been doing that. To be truthful, I can only do 3 laps and 20 pushups twice, but it's good for somebody out of shape like me. Tangent: Why do you think they put the verizon telephone booth at such a convenient angle in Sex and the City? And how awesome is it that Ron Livingston is in that show? That guy is the man I mean Office Space was pure genius. It has that slow humor that just kind of creeps up on you and makes you laugh after the movie's over. Very few movies can pull that off, and it's something to truly appreciate. Anyways I'mout. You guys rock. Keep it real love the people who love you and dont take anything to seriously. Life is too short to not enjoy every moment possible.
