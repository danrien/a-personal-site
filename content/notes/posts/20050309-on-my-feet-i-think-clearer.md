# On my feet I think clearer

Hey guys. Having a hard time feeling tired so thought I'd make a midnight post (well sort of midnight). And instead of doing homework, for example English, where I have to do "real" writing, I decided to do this. It's always easier to do something when you don't have to do it. So I was thinking about friends tonight. I thought to myself, "how do I know who my real friends are?", and I came to a simple conclusion. A true friend, among other things, is a friend who you can argue with, who you can be in a huge fight with, and moments later be best buds again. Examples of this can be found all over, but the most glaring example is marriage. When you marry someone, hopefully you do it for more than lustful longings (ooo sexy!!), namely, you do it because you are a type of best friend. I mean, think of how many times your parents (my apologies to kids with divorced parents) have had fights and then minutes later been talking to you about your homework and whatnot. Although there still might be some underlying tension, your parents choose to forgo the fighting, at least for the moment, for the sake of their marriage and you (and don't think they quit just because of you, they probably did the same thing when you weren't there too). Now, couples who have divorced are probably different, and I have no right to speak for them since I have been spared from that type of pain. But it just makes me think of my best friends. I've had huge arguments with them in the past. In the end, we both would just be like "fuck it" and continue on with our lives. We would realize that our friendship was way too awesome to screw it up over something stupid. So hopefully that gives some people insight into friendship, and maybe into me as well ;). So yeh I think I'm going to try hacking out some physics or something. Maybe touch my english paper. WHO KNOWS?

**[mandi o mandi](#22 "2005-03-09 16:51:00"):** Vedvick- Thanks for not spilling the beans. A friend is something you have to cherish, and a loved one is someone who gives you sex. (haha. just kidding) I loved your post. Mandi
