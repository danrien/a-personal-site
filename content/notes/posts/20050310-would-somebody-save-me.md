# Would somebody save me??

Hey guys. Just finished watching season 2 of Smallville. Let me tell you, it's quite the clincher. The lyric up there is from the opening theme song, so don't think I need to be saved. Even though I do. Just kidding. Haha. Anyhoo, thought I should pass on the message from my roommate, Evan. Any sexy babes out there that want a prime piece of real estate, you better get it while the gettin's good. I'm talking about Evan of course. Speaking of roommates, I was in the roommate game tonight, which is like the newlywed game. Apparently me and Evan don't know eachother very well. :( But oh we do ;). Nevermind, you didn't hear that. LOL Now that I've sufficiently grossed out anyone with an imagination, have a good night.
