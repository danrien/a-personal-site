# Give him bottles of lies

Now Listening To: 'Losing Hope' by 'Jack Johnson' from 'Brushfire Fairytales' on Media Center 10.0 Just went to the movie Hostage and I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed. I guess I went into it not expecting to much but coming out, I was really surprised. The story is just really compelling, even though it can be a bit predictable at times (they still manage to pull some nice surprises). But really, Bruce Willis gives another A+ performance and his supporting cast does a really good job too. Like I said, the plot is very interesting and it's a whole new take on the hostage deal. Recommended. Peace
