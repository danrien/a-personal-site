# So bored I had to make another post

I am so bored right now that I had to make another post. Not to beat a dead dog, but I am just bored out of my mind now that my main B-Town friends are gone. I guess that's why my little online repository is getting so much attention by me (and seemingly only me) in the past couple of days. I was just thinking about..... nothing. I'm so bored even my brain has stopped functioning. Well I think I'm going to do my computer programming assignment, maybe that will get some neurons firing again. Other than that, have a good nite/day or whatever you choose!
