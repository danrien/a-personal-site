# What's that riding on you reverything?

Hey guys and girls. Making my daily late night posting. Well today has certainly been interesting. SO interesting in fact that I was able to get in half of one Lord of the Rings movie (a feat in itself) and 2 episodes of the OC, as well as 2 episodes of Smallville (sorry Evan!). But yah I was being sarcastic on the interesting part. The most exciting thing I did today was down like 10 packets of sugar. Currently I think that's what's keeping me up. In fact I don't even know if I'm thinking clearly right now, but for the sake of argument, we'll go ahead and give it a thumbs up. I also went shopping with my mommy today. Bought some cool shirts, who knows, I might have style someday. Or I could be the flannel king like Clarke Kent. Speaking of Clarke Kent and Smallville. My buddy who's watched some of them ruined something VERY IMPORTANT for me. The bastard. I won't tell you because I don't want you to go through the same silent agony that I did, but just know it's extremely important and involves a beautiful blonde journalist. AGGH THE AGONY!!!!!! With that, Go Fuck Yourself San Diego.
