# It isn't anything at all

Hey. I haven't made a post in a whole day!! Guess that means that all my complaining shot up my karma again and gave me something to do! Anyways, pretty eventful 2 days for having them off. Yesterday I went to the golf course my dad takes care of and picked up trash to help prepare it for opening in a few weeks. That was exciting!!!!! (Heavy sarcasm) After that I went to a movie with my roommate who drove to town for the night. It's called "The Jacket" and it's way different then the previews make it look and it was way better than what I expected. I recommend a rental. Then I went to Perkins after that and saw a bunch of old classmates which is pretty cool. I swear everytime I go there, it's a class reunion. Today I ended up taking care of returning some gadgets that had busted on me. That's ALWAYS a bitch to do. Half the companies you talk to have like half-retarded Indonesian sheep on the other line and it's impossible to understand them and they have no idea what they're doing either. All they do is answer a phone and "baaaa" into the phone. I hear they make like 30 cents an hour, which is better than what I make, right around -5.00 an hour. Haha. Any how I'm either going to call it a night or go over to my buddy's and watch Smallville. Hope you aren't reading this Evan.
