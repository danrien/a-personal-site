# Today I woke up feeling worse than I have in years

Song lyric there. Alkaline Trio's the band. THEY ROCK. So I'm sitting here sipping on a Mountain Dew, mulling over the past few days for some new material to write about. Well, my friends got back into B-Town finally and we've been partying it up pretty wildly. I personally haven't been drinking, but that doesn't mean I can't have fun. The experience just isn't as enhanced as usual. Speaking of which, I just found out last night that Lent is officially over Sunday at the strike of midnight (or Saturday night depending on how you want to look at it), which is really cool and which means my planned tanked tuesday might not be the first day I indulge in my indulgences (is that the correct plural form?). Last night I had the fortunate chance to invite a couple of my friends from Fargo to a party. That was really cool and kind of crazy, seeing as how I never really hung out with these girls back in the high school days but I do alot now and it's just really awesome. We usually have fun, and so it was cool showing them how I used to have fun and what I used to do (and what I will inevitably be doing next summer). Today I could've gone and picked up trash for my dad but I just didn't feel any motivation. For some reason I don't feel like being more bored than I am here. At least here, I can stare at a computer screen and look at the same websites OVER and OVER again. It's pretty awesome. I think I'm now going to watch the O.C...... I mean the manliest show ever. I would never watch that faggish show.
