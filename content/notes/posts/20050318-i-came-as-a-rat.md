# I came as a rat

Listening to: 'Gravity Rides Everything' from 'The Moon & Antarctica' by 'Modest Mouse' on Media Center 10 SO I decided that it was far too much work to pick up garbage for my dad. Guess that says alot about my future career choices haha. But you know I was thinking about it and there's a reason I can't handle picking up garbage. It's just too damn boring. While I could be making pretty good money doing an extremely easy job instead I choose to sit here and fool around with my computers. Guess that's why I'm working to become an engineer, I always like the challenge. Anyways, yesterday was St. Patty's day and yesterday I possibly did less than ever, which is quite amazing. I think I reached the saturation point of hanging out with drunks the other night so I just kind of have been distancing myself from that again. Oh well. See ya
