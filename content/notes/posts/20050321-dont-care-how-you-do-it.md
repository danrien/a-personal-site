# Don't care how you do it

Hey guys. Just burning the midnight oil here. So I'm finally back in Fargo and things are as they always are. It finally got warm in Fargo while I was gone and after tomorrow it's supposed to get cold again. Bastards. Hopefully those weathermen are dismally wrong or else they're going to have hell to pay. I mean what would they do if I stopped going to their website? Last night I watched Alien vs. Predator while fixing my friend's family computer. Got 25 bones for that and I'm thankful for that. Hopefully in the near future I can get a computer business open and can start fixing computers for some extra cash. Nothing wrong with using your talents to finance your life, right? But anyways AvP sucked, I fell asleep, and yeh I'm going to go to bed and sleep again. SEE ya tomorrow.
