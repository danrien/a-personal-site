# I could be serious but I'm just kidding around

Listening to: 'Love Is Hell' from 'Love Is Hell' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 10 Hey guys. Been a couple days, hasn't it? Well I guess I kind of got PISSED OFF after my cousin said it seems like all I do is sit on the computer. Fucker. I guess there might be an inkling of truth to that but if there is, I don't see it. I mean, I'm on my computer like 8 hours a day. That's not even close to how often there are girls in my bed. Psssh. (When in doubt, always make fun of yourself) So now I'm going to nap and listen to the soothing voice of Ryan Adams while I fall asleep. PS You guys know that there's a new Weezer single out? You can listen to it [here](http://boss.streamos.com/wmedia/geffen/weezer/audio/make_believe/beverly_hills/00_lo.asx?siteid=weezersite). Peace.
