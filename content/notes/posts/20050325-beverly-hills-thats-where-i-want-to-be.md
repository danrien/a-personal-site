# Beverly Hills â€” That's where I want to be

Listening to: 'Beverly Hills' by 'Weezer' on Media Center 10 Well I hopefully had my last night of driving drunks around for a while tonight. Not that I mind doing it, but it's nice to know that when you're out drinking you don't have to always be the one driving. However, when you're always sober, the responsibility is quite the opposite and it can be quite a burden sometimes. Glad I could save your lives :). Anyhow, has anyone else ever noticed that some of the other blogs appear to be nothing other than spam?? That really blows that some punkass 25 year olds are taking advantage of an honestly cool use of modern technology. Fuckers. Guess I like swearing these days. Sorry about the uncensored work. Speaking of censorship, I'm doing a debate in english on debate. Anyone got opinions?
