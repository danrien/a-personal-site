# Weezer Fever

Hey guys. I guess the fever's setting in, the fever where I NEED the new thing that's coming out. This can range from anything from a book to a new computer part, but as of right now it's the new Weez CD Make Believe. I really should give them a break, I mean they don't even have it finished mixing yet. But you can count on a countdown showing up :D. Sometimes I think it's almost better desiring something you can't have than actually being able to actually have it. It gives you something to wait for, something to strive for, something to work for. It instills a passion in you that probably shouldn't really be associated with "worldly" possesions. And that brings me to another thought. Perhaps the whole thing wrong in America right now (not that there necessarily is, but it's always good to look at yourself and see what problems you can solve) is that we value such objects so much. And maybe that's why we have such problems with marriage and relationships; once we get what we can't have, we realize that we never really should've had it in the first place. That's also what kind of bothers me about Republicans, they seem to value ownership so much but at the same time say they hold true to Christian values. Didn't Jesus say the richest man was poorer than the poorest? To be honest, I can't say much on it, I'm neither theologian or political analyst, but those are my thoughts on it. I'd just like to see the day where we all work for eachother, not for ourselves and only ourselves. Guaranteed that day's a long way off. Haha. Right now I'm listening to Run by Snow Patrol. You guys should really give them a try. And girls. But really, they have a sick sound and just make you kind of look inward. It's cool. Alright I'm out. Hope everyone's (all 30 billion of you) are still reading this! Keep it real girls and guys.
