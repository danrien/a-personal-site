# Chillin in a new situation

Well I just recently got my mp3 player back. THANK GOD. Now I can continue on with my tradition of ignoring people while listening to music. Today's selection is Ryan Adam's all day long. It is going to be awesome. I think I might go workout, but I just turned The Two Towers on, and I might just have to sit down and watch that until my english meeting. Speaking of english, I'm not sure if I said this before, but me and a couple other people are doing a debate on censorship. Hopefully I can poke some of you guys for ideas. It really shouldn't be that tough but it would be nice to hear ideas from you guys.
