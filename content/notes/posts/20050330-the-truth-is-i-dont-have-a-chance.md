# The truth is, I don't have a chance

Whats up people! So the new weez song is getting better and better every time I listen to it and I'm just really stoked for the new cd now. It is going to be awesome. Hey, you notice I put a countdown to the right? Yah I said I was going to. Well, life is pretty boring, not much to say, no stories, no drama, no observations etc. etc. Other than that I'm really sorry I haven't been updating alot, I guess I should be focusing on this more because I really like to do it. My mp3 player is ruining it I think. Peace.
