# Oprah's the BEST

Hey peoples. Watching Oprah right now with EvanLee, and boy is it racey! Apparently there's a lot of swinging housewives are out there! Some interesting news in the world today. Terri Schiavo died, and this odd chapter of news in America in 2005 is finally over. Also my poor pope is sick again. It seems these days he spends most of his time in the hospital and you have to wonder how much he is doing with the church these days. While I hope he gets better, I also hope that with his weakening state the church won't become more conservative again. It's common knowledge within the church that our current pope has brought major change to the catholic church, and most of it for the better. If we regress from that, as some speculate we are, then I fear for the future of the church. Oh well much will not change in the world of religion.
