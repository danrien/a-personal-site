# But wait, you can breathe/You can see what I can see

Listening to: 'Lolita' from 'Language. Sex. Violence. Other?' by 'Stereophonics' on Media Center 11 Hey guys. Just had a really cool experience. I was listening to the song Rewind by Stereophonics (the same CD actually) as I was walking back from a hard-ass physics test and it fit so well with the nice new freshness of another spring. The song has a really sweet line that goes like 

> If you could rewind your time Would you change your life? 

(courtesy [azlyrics.com](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/stereophonics/rewind.html)) So would you? The song goes on and says forget about yesterday, worry about today, there's time to change. Spring is about change. The combination of the two is awesome and I recommend it to everyone. And it gives you something to think about. Very good CD by the way. Recommended. That's all I've got for right now. I realize my writing was a little jilted there so do what you can to understand what I said there and hopefully you get something out of it. Talk to me and I'll give you the song so you can get the full experience. :)
