# I used to be sad but I'm just bored with you.

Hey guys. I'm watching the Godfather for the first time right now and I'm missing alot because I want to make a post. So what I do is I have Evan explain it to me so I don't have to pay attention to that damn Italian Godfather and his raspy Italian bullshit. Enjoy yourselves people. I will strike back with my Vengeance. ![](http://photos1.blogger.com/img/177/3736/320/godfather-title.jpg) The Movie that I'm currently watching
