# Goodbye, Father

Well, it has happened. After a long and arduous struggle with Parkinson's and multiple illnesses, he has finally taken the last path home. Although I cannot say for myself where I will go when I die, I think there is no question in anyone's mind that if the heavens exist, he is there along with all those before him and anxiously awaiting those to come. He was truly a man who brought peace to the world through his actions. He took the gift of his position, and influenced the world order as it was known and changed the world. He ended communism in Europe and is responsible for a lot of the changes that have occured for the better in this world. The world couldn't ask for a better man, and yet he proved to all of us that we can all be just as good. His life is one to be cherished, and now I anxiously await the appointment of the new Pope. But for now, let's mourn his passing. Goodbye, Father.
