# I should really stop....

Last night was horrid. I had a can of dew around 10 and it kept me up until around 3:30 or so in the AM. THAT BLOWS. But why oh why would I subject my self to such torture? Well it simply is because over the short term I desire a can of dew (yes the full 12 ounces) far more than sleep that I'll be trying to get in 4 hours or so. Which is kind of sickening, and is why I need to stop. Thus, the title. Hey, once again, I know I've done this a thousand times, but I'll say it again, sorry I've been so lax on my blogging. I love to do it but I run out of material, people! And since people have started putting a death warrant on my head for not posting as much anymore, I figure I should apologize. Deep thoughts from the Abyss: "Do not tie shoes too tight. You'll never know when you'll need to run." I have no idea where I got that from or if it even makes sense, but THINK ABOUT IT OK. Peace people. I'm gonna have a can of dew.
