# Here you are, and there's where you wanna be

Listening to: 'Start Over' from 'Humanistic' by 'Abandoned Pools' on Media Center 11 Wow. Weezer and Abandoned Pools in one year. What are the odds. For those of you who don't know, Abandoned Pools is one of the best never heard of bands out there. They have so much raw talent its just shocking and I can't wait! Actually the fact that Abandoned Pools is releasing a new cd is coming as a bit of a shock as I thought they were broken up after their first CD kinda failed and whatnot. But apparently they got signed with Universal and they're going to give it another shot. [Here's their website](http://www.abandonedpools.com/). 

> I know it's strange, so are you brave enough?
