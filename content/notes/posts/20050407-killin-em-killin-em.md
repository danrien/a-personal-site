# Killin em, killin em

In English today I had to debate over censorship. I had to debate for pro-censorship (which I don't agree with), and I just ripped them apart. I think my ability to do that comes from arguing with all my friends all the time. So I'd like to thank all of you for the opportunity to bitch with you. As far as anything else I have to say goes, well since mr anonymity chose to slam me I guess I'll just have to pass on saying anything DOUCHEBAG
