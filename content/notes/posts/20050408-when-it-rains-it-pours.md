# When it rains it pours

Listening to: 'Satin in a Coffin' from 'Good News for People Who Love Bad News' by 'Modest Mouse' on Media Center 11 List of things to do tonight: 

  1. Let Mandi dress me up
  2. Get drunk off of martinis with my future roommates 
  3. Go to Grand Forks with B-Town Comrades 
Unfortunately it seems many of my plans are colliding. :S Sorry people this always happens to me at the worst moments. Some weekends I spend the entire day looking at the same damn webpages that never update and others I spend trying to figure out where I should go next. Oh well. Anyways, I think I will have to choose option 2 for tonight. Mandi, you are still welcome to dress me, but only if I get to...umm..... yeh. Haha. And B-Towners, I'd love to join you, but I have responsibilities in Fargo. But, if you would like me to be there, come back around 11 and get me I should be good and ready for partying in the Grand Forks. I watched the movie Mulholland Dr. last night and phew let me tell you. That movie is more messed up than a cracked out baby with severe brain damage. Let me give you the low down: 2 hot girls get on eachother. The rest is just fuckin wild. With that, all I have left to say is Sheyann you need to read my blog. Oh wait I should probably tell you that on MSN, shouldn't I? Haha too bad. Guess you gotta read it on your own. PEACE
