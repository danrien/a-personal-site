# I've come down with something

Listening to: 'American Girl' by 'Rivers Cuomo' on Media Center 11 Hey everybody. I just finished reading this article on an interesting new malady of the 21st century. Actually, I'm not even sure if it could be called a disorder technically, but for us geeks it certainly is. It's called NADD, or Nerd Attention Deficit Disorder. To find out about it and treat me, [here's the website](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html). I think I'm actually a mild sufferer of this. While I sometimes do have 30 browser windows open, a game of Bejeweled going on, some music turned on, and a TV, I can only do that for like 4-5 hours. At that point I burn out and I have to sleep or go out or something. But it is fun. God I'm a nerd. Saw them doing the staff training downstairs today and that was kind of depressing, since I could've possibly been there too. Oh well I made my decision a while ago and I'm not looking back. Bitches. Peace Out. By the way Chris Hoppe's a fag and wants to get it up the ass.
