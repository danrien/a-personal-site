# Baby I'm a lost cause

Did an interesting thing last night. Pulled an all nighter by myself. Why? Probably mostly because I had loads of caffeine in me, but some of it had to do with something else.... I think. While I was awake (and doing homework, which is odd), I was trying to figure out why I just couldn't fall asleep. Usually, even when I'm extremely caffeinated, I can fall asleep at some point, but not last night. I thought it might be a girl, but then I realized no girls have ever bothered me before, and I couldn't think of what girl would cause this kind of turmoil in my brain. Then I realized it! It was like Father Paul Duchscher (my second cousin, btw) had said a couple weekends ago in mass: I wasn't at peace with myself last night. Sometimes that can be because of a girl, but this was different. It was because I was so determined on getting my homework done! I didn't realize it until I was eating breakfast. I'm only at peace with myself when I'm being myself. When I'm chillin to the max. When I just don't care. That's why I love lifeguarding. That's why I love sittin around with my buds sippin on beer. The whole go for it attitude is just not me, and when I do that, my mind goes into a sort of "shock" state as I like to call it that doesn't let me rest until I achieve my goal. Back in high school, swimming did this for me. If I wasn't coming home every night tired as all hell, I'd stay up till 3 or 4 in the morning. Sometimes, even when I did come home wasted as all hell I still would stay up. I was determined to be the best I could be at swimming and nothing would stop me. Now, I've started to apply that to college. All I hope is that this doesn't apply to my future. If I get like this with other shit, I could have a very messed up life. Hopefully that doesn't happen. Hopefully living by the ocean will help me revert to myself whenever I need to. Let me be at peace. Peace be with you.
