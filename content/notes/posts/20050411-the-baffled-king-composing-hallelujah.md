# The baffled King composing Hallelujah

Listening to: 'Hallelujah' from 'Grace' by 'Jeff Buckley' on Media Center 11 Hey. Been writing a 5 page english paper and so far I've got 2 pages. Right now, my goal is to finish the next half of the page and then really take off. I'm writing on whether Alternative Energy should be developed now or later. From what I've seen, the consensus seems to be that no matter what we may decide in our hearts, the government is going to be to pokey to get anything done until their is a real energy shortage in America. So I'm wasting a page and a half saying we should do it now, trying to argue for it. Unfortunately it seems the decisions already been made and therefore I have NOTHING to write on. C'mon guys, throw me a bone. PEACE

It was fun when there were only a few of them and you could truly express yourself, but thinking up shit just to get by isn't very fun. I'd be nice to just sleep for a bit, play some games, eat some food, and play outside in the rain or other waterfalls.
