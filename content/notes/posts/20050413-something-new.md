# Something new

Today I started drinking coffee. It's my new tradition. I'm going to be a caffeine nut anyway I look at it, so I figure I should at least do it right. I had some deep thoughts earlier today but I forgot them so you'll have to forgive me. Forgot about my allergy shot yesterday too. oops. What is great is that these things are starting to pay off. Finally, I'm able to function like a normal human being for the most part. I can walk outside without killing myself sinus wise. Thank god. peace
