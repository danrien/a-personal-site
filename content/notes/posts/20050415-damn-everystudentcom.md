# DAMN EVERYSTUDENT.COM

Hey guys. There is a movement going on at my college to push a new website, everystudent.com, and it's getting really fucking annoying. The worst thing is, the advertisements for it are nondescript. It's like the people pushing this site know that kids won't want to go the site knowing it's about god and whatnot. I think the problem with this is simple: they're trying to preach to the choir. I simply don't see why they're trying to push God on people who already know him. It's just so ridiculous it makes me want to puke. In my modest Catholic church, we learn that modesty and humility is most important. They teach that going out and saying look at me I'm christian blah blah blah fuckity fuck is just bullshit. It basically boils down to bragging about being a christian. You didn't see Jesus bragging about being God's son. He just said he was, and that was enough. I'm no theologian. I'm not even a good christian. I'm a fucking sinner and I know it. I'd love to change, and I'd love to think that every day I move closer to that goal, but it's baby steps. But these people give off this aura that they know my God, and well all I have to say to them is go fuck yourself.
