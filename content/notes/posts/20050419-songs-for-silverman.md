# Songs for Silverman

Ben Folds has a new CD coming out! Of course, I already aquired it, due to my super secret sources inside the music industry (just kidding RIAA â€” don't come after me!). It also had an adverse effect on my internet bandwidth. But that's just because NDSU is slightly homosexual and seems to like other universities of its own sex. However, due to the wonders of the internet and the various criminal organizations taking advantage of it, I will instead give you guys the benefit and give you a review of the CD. Ben Folds is an old school piano rocker. By old school, I mean late eighties early nineties, so he has the funky new age rock thing going on with his piano. He also has a lot of pop in his sound, so his music appeals to people of various musical preferences. Unfortunately, his music also seems to have either a like a lot or dislike appeal to it. What Ben Folds does in Songs for Silverman is grow up. He's now nearly forty and has a wife and a couple of kids so for him to write about being pissed off about his girlfriend and this and that is a little difficult for him. Luckily, he doesn't do it. What he does is he seems to create people and situations similar to what most middle aged middle class men would feel (I think...?). He conveys lots of emotion through his music and it seems like sometimes he does reminiscing on the past and all that good stuff. He still manages to maintain a boppin sound and some poppy feel, which is good, it keeps us inline with the Ben Folds we are all used to. His piano goodness seems to be a little more complicated, which is cool too. Over all, it's a great CD and worth a listen at least. Unless you don't like him. Which means I don't like you. Peace.
