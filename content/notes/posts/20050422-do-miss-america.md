# Do Miss America

Guys and Girls listen to RYAN ADAMS goddamit. This guy changes my life daily. Every single time I listen to one of his songs (which is about every 4 minutes unless I'm in class, in which case I'm humming one of his tunes), some new emotion boils up inside of me. It can't be expressed. But to delve yourself into Ryan Adams is like taking a plunge in a 100 foot pool and swimming to the bottom. And when you think you've reached the bottom, you find it's far away. Here are some lyrics from one of his songs (courtesy of [Cowboy Lyrics](http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/adams-ryan/do-miss-america-11169.html))

"Do Miss America" So, tell me how you feel without your medicine Hold your head feelin' paranoid Sweet sixteen for a schizoid So, tell me how you feel Now you're the only one Held your head in the setting sun Sweet black smoke with the poison Hey, come everybody do Miss America Hey, you know when she goes down it's hysterical So, tell me how you feel without your medicine Hold your head feeling paranoid Running down the street from a mergatroid So, tell me how you feel Now you're the only one Held your head in the setting sun Sweet black smoke from a crooked gun Hey, come everybody do Miss America Hey, you know when she goes down it's hysterical

Well that's all. I think I'm sort of braindead this week, after 3 tests (1 more to go). Sort of like finals week, but with all the classes. The only thing fortunate about this week is that the tests aren't cumulative, which is pretty damn good. You guys keep it real.
