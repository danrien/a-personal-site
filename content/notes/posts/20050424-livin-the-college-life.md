# Livin the college life

This weekend has been a total bore. Well, not total bore, but it has for the most part been a sober weekend. Which is cool and good, but still takes some of the excitement from the weekend. However, I did get the chance to eat an excellent spaghetti supper that my sister made. Tasted just like home, which is fuckin awesome. Not too much to say, watching American Beauty right now and it's pretty damn sweet, even though it's my second time. PEACE
