# A lifetimes tragedy inside a single song

Listening to: 'Lolita' from 'Language. Sex. Violence. Other?' by 'Stereophonics' on Media Center 11 I have an insano mix bumpin right now. Captain Insano that is. He's singing. No he's not. Actually, it's Sterophonics, Pete Yorn, and Lifehouse. One word: WTF. Haha. Bet you didn't get that joke. Well, right now I'm runnin off of 4 or so hours of sleep. It is pretty sweet. I think I think clearer when I'm tired. Or else I just get so confused that everything becomes clear. Whatever the hell that means. You guys try to decipher a tired mans words. I sure as hell can't do it. Anyways, Carmela Decesare is really damn hot. And she's seducing me as I stare at her. Enjoy life. You only get to play it one time.
