# Lifehouse is good.... what?

Listening to: 'Dakota' from 'Language. Sex. Violence. Other?' by 'Stereophonics' on Media Center 11 Everybody remember that awful song Spin that was on the radio awhile ago? It was by the band Lifehouse, and it was so overplayed that it just about killed me. Turns out that the band is actually good, which I know can't be right. But wait... it is. Damnit. But yeh their new CD, self-titled, is actually really mellow and good. I recommend to all interested. Good stuff. Yeh. SHiiiit But a word of warning to the wise: don't just go and try to rip this CD onto your computer using any normal ripping program. And the FBI warning on the back of the CD, forget about that. It only applies to people making copies for illegal purposes, which is basically anything other than a backup. I should sometime put up my paper on copy protection and all that stuff. When I write it. I digress. In order to rip the CD, I would recommend getting Audiograbber [here](http://www.audiograbber.com-us.net/). It's a little complicated, but I will be more than willing to help you, if you give me a beer. :D Im out.
