# Smoke cigarettes when we can coz we like to

Listening to: 'Lolita' from 'Language. Sex. Violence. Other?' by 'Stereophonics' on Media Center 11 Hey guys. Something new is occuring in the world of DVD burning. It seems that some devious studios are starting to pick up on this little phenomenon and are coming up with ways to trick devices. What they do is insert so called "dummy sectors", basically sections on a disc that look like scratches to a DVD drive. The thing is, when watching a movie, the DVD drive will just skip over these sectors (like it does with most scratches), but when a drive tries to copy it, it will get stuck because it wants to copy all the sectors. Fortunately, most nerds are smarter than those companies and they've already found ways to identify these sectors and skip them. HA! This came to my attention after trying to burn The Forgotten, which is an excellent movie. At least burn worthy. Which I don't do. But if you were to perhaps burn movies, I would recommend you do it. But come talk to me, I know how to do it. ;) Anyways, see ya guys later keep it real keep it safe keep it here.
