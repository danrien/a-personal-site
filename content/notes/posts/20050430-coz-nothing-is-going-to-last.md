# Coz nothing is going to last

Listening to: 'Ender Will Save Us All' from 'The Swiss Army Romance' by 'Dashboard Confessional' on Media Center 11 Whats up peoples. Chillin in Bismarck right now......... had to move my Concordia-Moorhead going sister back home for the summer. It really sucks having two weeks of school left. I just got done with what I like to call "Hell Week" since it occured and now I am preparing for another, school approved Hell Week sure to be above and beyond all Hell Weeks combined. In short, it will be a Hell Week worthy of all Hell Weeks. In other words, I just said the same thing 2 or 3 times. Going off of around 6 hours of sleep right now, which isn't too bad, considering my past stunts, but still it makes everything around you (well me) go a little faster. It really is like drinking, except not as extreme, therefore you don't have your poor body rushing to compensate for it by pumping out dopamines everywhere. Thank god for Miller Lite.... I hope that they have stockpiles of it in heaven.... of course God prolly wouldn't like us badmouthing all the angels and stuff while we were drunk so maybe that isn't a good idea..... Lots of periods in this post............
