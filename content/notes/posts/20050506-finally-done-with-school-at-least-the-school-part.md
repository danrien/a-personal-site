# Finally done with school.... at least the school part

Listening to: 'Walk With You' from 'Silent Steeples' by 'Dispatch' on Media Center 11 Finally!!! Another semester over! Except for the tests! And that one class in an hour and a half! Oh wellll......... It doesn't even mean anything is over because I am going to be taking more classes this summer at BSC, Calc 2 probably. So how are the grades looking? ECE 173 (Intro to Programming) - B ECE 275 (Digital Systems I) - C MATH 165 (Calculus I) - C PHYS 251 (University Physics I) - B/C ENGL 120 (English II) - B/C Looks like I'm pulling a 2 right about now... :(. Not much to do about it anymore, I guess I'll have to hit the books hard next week for the Finals. Unfortunately I'm a horrible studier, especially when NADD (Nerd Attention Deficit Disorder) kicks in. But my problem mostly stems from my burning desire to not do whatever I'm doing, especially if I'm supposed to be doing it. What I really need are some Beautiful Babies to help me.... Help!! OUt.
