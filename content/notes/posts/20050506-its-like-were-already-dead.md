# It's like we're already dead

Listening to: ['Cry on Demand' from 'The Suicide Handbook' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11](http://www.gracenote.com/xm/pcd/genalt/4dd293a9a532af549143160ae53ee4f2.html) What's up guys. Can you tell I'm bored? So far tonight I've called....almost no one. Except for that beautiful baby, I can't remember her name but I believe she might have had a birthday a few days ago.... oh well doesn't matter she won't call me back. Bitch. JUST KIDDING! Kids this post is R-rated. A little late for that, you say? Well FUCK YOU! There how's that for some damn R-rating? Went to Sin City last weekend, and let me tell you, it was BADASS. We're talking Kill Bill here ladies and gentlemen, except without the story to get in the way (which is good or bad, depending on how you feel on that matter). But really, it's damn cool. Lots of ladies. Naked. Lots of blood. In full color red. Need I say more? Well just in case you think I should, I'll keep on ranting about it here. The movie brings in some of the best actors in the biz such as [Bruce Willis](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/), [Jessica Alba](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004695/), [Michael Madsen](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000514/), [etc](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/). All of these actors and actresses do a splendid job. I'd imagine it's like doing one of those stage acting jobs where you really get to flex your actor's muscle and show all the drama and emotion you can in your face and voice. It is SICK LIKE A DICK! Hey you people keep it real Did anyone notice I'm doing lots of links in this post? I'm bored.
