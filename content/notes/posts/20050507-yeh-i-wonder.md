# Yeh I wonder....

Listening to: 'Man In Uniform' from 'Day I Forgot' by 'Pete Yorn' on Media Center 11 Hey there ;). You dirty blog reader you like it don't you. Yes you do. ADMIT IT!! YOU LIKE IT!! Reaching a new level of boredom, blogging at 9:50 in the damn morning. I was thinking though that I could brag about a recent CD purchase: Ryan Adams CD Cold Roses. IT'S SICK! Anyways that's all. PEACE.
