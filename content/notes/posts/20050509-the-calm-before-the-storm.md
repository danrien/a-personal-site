# The Calm before the Storm

So I'm hunkered down in my room in Reed hall right now, preparing for the onslaught of coming finals. I've already started studying for my first test, which is surprising since I'm a member of the procrastinators club on Facebook. That damned social complex. For the record, I'm still fully against Facebook even though I'm a member and I'm addicted. Damn you! Go back to your demon lords Facebook! I hate you and the way you make me feel. All popular and stuff. Some guy just added me and I have NO IDEA who he is. WTF. Got the keys for my apartment the other day and I've been hangin out there a bit recently. It's bad ass... it rocks.... I'm in love with the idea of total freedom. Except from the people you owe money to. I guess it's impossible to completely free yourself from a dependency on society, unless you free yourself from society period and become a hermit. Right now I've finished eating some easy mac and I'm going to play some puzzle games and get rid of some stress. Hey you people: keep it real.
