# Oh won't you stay.... American Baby

Listening to: 'American Baby' from 'Stand Up' by 'Dave Matthews Band' on Media Center 11 Hey guys. It's getting a little rough here in the middle of the storm. The rain started pouring this morning and it got so bad I almost felt sick. My Digital Systems final went fine, but the added weight of the computer programming test wore me down. By the time I was finishing that test, I was hardly looking through the question before answering. The punishment was so bad I couldn't even focus. This is what I get for choosing to be a Computer Engineer, and this is the burden I accepted going into it. Guess I just found out what it's like to hold your future in the span of a few hours. Now I'm heading to our computer lab to print out tests to study for tomorrow's Calculus final. This should be good.
