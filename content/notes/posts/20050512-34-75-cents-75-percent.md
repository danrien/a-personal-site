# 3/4 75 cents 75 Percent

Listening to: 'Old Dirt HIll (Bring That Beat Back)' from 'Stand Up' by 'Dave Matthews Band' on Media Center 11 Done. With 3 out of 4. Now that wasn't so bad was it? To tell the truth, as I was taking my Calculus I final this morning, I didn't even care. Somehow, I should. After all, if I don't get a C in this class then that means I will have to take Calc again. That would be numero tres, and I just don't if I have the stomach for that. Yesterday I said I was in the middle of the storm and the rain was pouring. Ironically, I'm just starting to pull out of my own personal weather system and all of Fargo's now starting to feel the after effects of Finals. It's raining and there's a chance of snow. Just pretend it's not May. A Physics final is all I've got left now and I'm about ready to be done. A friends here so I'm out. PEACE
