# Weep as the earth and be free

You Bismarck people might be wondering where I am right now, and truth is, I am as far away from you guys as I can be without leaving this continent (well except for Mexico, but I'm not far from there). Right now I'm in Austin, Texas. So far, I've driven 22+ hours, gone to an NBA playoff game (the Spurs won), and seen Revenge of the Sith on a sweet screen at 3 in the morning. Other than that, I haven't done much else but play computer games. Props to Mark Frohlich for letting me use his account. Anywho, got more games to play, I'm out. PEACE.
