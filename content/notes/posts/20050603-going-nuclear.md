# Going nuclear

Listening to: 'When I Want' from 'Demo' by 'Jimmy Eat World' on Media Center 11 Hey guys and gals! Motherfuckers and Bitches! You people ROCK. Right now I'm chilling in my room and it's about the first time since Austin that I've felt like really exercising my writing muscles, so all apologies to ravid readers. All one of you, including myself. WELL as far as the journal aspects of this post go, there really isn't too much to write home about. I've been chilling for the most part and logging in lots of sleep. Probably too much sleep, but I've appreciated the sleep and it's been really good for my body and mind, which went through lots of stress throughout the last two or three weeks of school and then of course the Texas. Other than that, I've started working at Hillside. I also got a job at the local Y now too, so I'm going to get lots of work this summer, which is kinda the plan. Unfortunately (and fortunately, but not so much so) that also means I'm going to do a lot less partying, which also means I'll spend lots less money, which is the fortunate part of the equation. Apologies to all the people I promised to call last week or so and never did. Trust me, you weren't the only one I didn't call back. But I'm slowly getting back into the swing of the way Bismarck works and starting to enjoy myself again, especially now that I've come out of hibernation. Anyway, you people keep it real.....I'll be looking forward to seeing all of you!
