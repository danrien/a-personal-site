# In the depth of your mind you find me

Listening to: 'Creep' from 'Thank You' by 'Stone Temple Pilots' on Media Center 11 Hey dudes. It's been a long ass time, I'm not going to lie. I've gotten really horrible at this in the past few months, haven't I? Well maybe that's because you people give me no incentive! Click on one of the damn ads (they're above and below the blog) and maybe I'll write my ass off for you. But anyways that's all for the shameless self advertising. You guys might wonder what I've been doing lately, and truth is, not much. Here is my daily schedule: 10:00 â€” Go to Calc 2 10:30 â€” Hoping for it to be 11:40 11:10 â€” Give up hope 11:40 â€” Stay longer because the teacher over extends his lecture 11:45 â€” Get out of class, go home, sit on computer, eat lunch blah 12:30 â€” Go work, complain about ppl at work, etc. 8:00 â€” Go home 8:45 â€” Feel like I should do homework 9:12:13 â€” Give up on homework 9:15 - 2:30 â€” Sit on computer and geek it up, wondering why I don't have a girlfriend Why is it that the I am Sam soundtrack is so damn good? Ugh. It's now 11 o'clock and I am officially an ass and a loser. My friend called wanting me to do something and being the dick I am I didn't call back. My justification to me was I needed to study, but I didn't do much studying. Who studies for math anyways? Maybe I'll do some bonus studying later on. Poor friend. I love you urbz you know it. I'm just lazy and an ass. I'll get my act together one of these days. Hey I'm playing this game called Eve online right now. It's pretty sweet because you don't really have to do much so I can play it, talk and write this. It's really cool. It's pretty taxing on the computer, but if any of you geeks out there wanna play it, there's a free demo at their website: [eve-online.com](http://www.eve-online.com/). So I mean, how much do you gain? Anything? Did it do anything for you? Did you lose something? Probably. But did you GAIN anything?
