# Pickin it up and never put it back down

Listening to: 'Cry Freedom' from 'Crash' by 'Dave Matthews Band' on Media Center 11 I have a question to ask you people. Should I delete the new White Stripes cd (because I dont really like it yet) or should I give it some more chances? Thanks. So life's been good to me lately. I don't have class this week which is a huge relief, but I still have to learn stuff online, so hopefully I don't fall behind in that area (don't count on it). Also, my friend's dad is gone ;) so that should be lots of fun. Also, I've discovered that some of the girls working at the pool are really damn hot. That's awesome. It's really sweet. Damn. But yeh, I'm going to head out or something. Sooooo I'll see you people later. PEace
