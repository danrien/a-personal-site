# If we were nothing we were only the best I'm just livin in a dream I guess

Listening to: 'Ruled by Secrecy' from 'Absolution' by 'Muse' on Media Center 11 I just downloaded this Mercora IMRadio thing. The idea behind it is that instead of downloading a song, you stream it from somebody else's computer. Because nobody is downloading anything no one is giving anyone else copyrighted material. However, I thought about it and I'm pretty sure copyright law also prohibits public display of music unless you have rights to broadcast it. Therefore you are still breaking copyright law. But it doesn't really matter anyway because the program SUCKS. Well not so much the program as the people on it. Why is it that NO ONE labels there music correctly? How am I supposed to know what 3dd.AwayFromTheSun.WIG.mp3 is? I especially hate it when the song is tagged incorrectly or not at all, therefore I have to go by that damn filename. In order to help all you people with messed up music names, I have a program for you: [Musicbrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/). This program will go through your music collection, analyze the songs, and correctly name the files and fill in the appropriate tags. PLEASE DO IT! But I digress. So yeh, I'm using this program and there's no real easy way to find music I like, or to easily categorize anything. It's all just a huge mess and it pissed me off. So I'm uninstalling it. Or something like that. Bye
