# Lazy Days at Hillside

Listening to: 'Blind' from 'Lifehouse' by 'Lifehouse' on Media Center 11 I love summer. It is possibly the BEST season of the year, and its effect is all the more amplified in North Dakota. For all the shit we go through for those other 9-10 months of the year, the depression that sets in during the last struggles of winter, and whatever else you can think of, it is all made worth it in these 3 months. Yesterday, do you wanna know what I did? I layed out and half-napped on the slide's deck. With the rush of water coming out of the slide (it sounds like a spring or something) and with the sun beating down on you, there really is nothing better. Especially when no one decides to go to the pool on that day. It makes me appreciate my life and appreciate being alive. Listening to: 'Cold Day In The Sun' from 'In Your Honor (CD2)' by 'Foo Fighters' on Media Center 11 So yeh it's all good stuff, and I'm happy right now, even without girls or anything (although I've got a few "projects" that I'm working on). peace.
