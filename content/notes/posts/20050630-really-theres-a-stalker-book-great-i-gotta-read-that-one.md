# Really? There's a stalker book? Great, I gotta read that one

Watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind today. It was great for the second time. I think I liked it more. Maybe. I'm not sure yet. My mother asked me to close my window if I go "out" tonight. I don't think I see that happening. Maybe. Who knows. But it's kind of funny how the world works, you know? It's like God or something, this higher power, he's working on us constantly. We don't know it, but he sure as hell does. And he's doing it all the time. It's just fucked up. Sometimes I feel like my decisions weren't even my decisions, like I'm running around in somebody else's brain, like I'm their creation or something. Then other times, I feel like I'm the brain and everybody's doing what I want them to. Messed up shit I tell you. Ever wonder about that? About being the brain, you know. What if you were the brain. What if you were able to play god in your own little world and everybody respected you. I guess that got games for that kind of shit and whatnot, but you never know. What if God is doing nothing more than playing a game. A game he himself created to keep himself occupied. A game that went bad, but he still plays it because he'd be lonely without us. I say this now with all humility, but maybe God keeps us going because if we weren't, he'd be lonely, and that's the worst feeling ever for him. We keep him occupied, interested. We're like a little kid for him, someone that thinks of something new everyday. That would be sweet and would make my world a little tighter. Anyways, nothing more to say other than F-you ppl I HATE YOU. Haha just kidding keep it real.
