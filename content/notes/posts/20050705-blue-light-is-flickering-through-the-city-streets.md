# Blue light is flickering through the city streets

Listening to: 'Whatever Happened To Soy Bomb' from 'Blinking Lights and other Revelations (CD2)' by 'Eels' on Media Center 11 The slow reality is the one that's worst. The ones that comes to you like a flashing light of brilliance, those are the ones to be grateful for. The slow ones, they creep up on you like a deathknell to your slowly beating heart. The realization of a new fact of life is great, but at the same time it hurts you, most likely because you had to learn it the hard way. You see what girls do to your mental faculties? HOW IN GOD'S SWEET NAME AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHEN TO MAKE A MOVE ON A GIRL GODDAMMIT I SUCK. Anyways, anger and whatnot aside, not much has been happening in my life. It chugs along like a steamboat or something, and not much exciting is happening. Like I just said. It's lovely, but drama's really sweet too. Or heartbreak. Or whatever I can get my grubby hands on. Unrequited love? Anybody? Oh well, that's what Shakespeare was for. I think the problem is my destiny lies within things that will never allow me to be super close to anybody. After all, I never have been really. Some people, alot of people actually, know me pretty well, you know, I wear my heart on my sleeve and all. But in reality, there's a core there, like a manifest destiny or something. And all these small events, I can't help but get the feeling that they are steps or something. And something. Had to get that word in one last time. To those dear readers of mind, don't mind the explosion above the previous paragraph, I only blame myself on my certain inequities with women. I suck, to put it plainly. But those subjects aside, I was supposed to hang out with friends tonight. Guess it didn't happen. I like doing this better sometimes anyways. Tonight I'll finish off Heretics of Dune and tomorrow I will once again go back into my quest for something I don't know quite yet what it is. Mastery of Life needs the aching heart too. David The day is coming when you'll have to think of it. Was it really worth it? All that shit.
