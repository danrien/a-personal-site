# Blood, Money, and Harry Potter

Listening to: 'Yellow Submarine' from '1' by 'The Beatles' on Media Center 11 As of today, I will be making money off of blood. And contrary to your thoughts, this will not be through killing people. Ah no, instead I will be giving my own blood. Coincidentally, it will be given back to me shortly after it is taken, minus a few plasma particles (or whatever their full name is). Yes, I have officially signed up for Biolife Plasma Services, but only after realizing just how poor I was (which is very poor in case you 're wondering). At any rate, that was my adventure today. I also got injected with some allergy serum to combat my seasonal (as in all year) allergies. I get them once every three weeks, and if all goes as planned I could possibly be done taking them in a year or two, that is if I don't fuck them up anymore than I already have. But ahhhh on to the last topic: Harry Potter. Yes, in between getting stuff taken and infused with other stuff, I have had time to pick up and read the latest in JK's phenomenal series. The night that they released Harry Potter to the teeming masses was amazing to say the least. Here in little ol' Bismarck, with a thriving population of 60,000, our Barnes and Noble was absolutely, most absolutely packed. I was so impressed my mouth was open the entire time I was there. Absolutely amazing. It was so packed that we couldn't move. So packed, that we decided to leave nearly 15 minutes after being there. Phenomenal (it's my new favorite word). Anyways, I think I'll leave a new post reviewing the book shortly, after all that's what the Making Money on Blogging guide told me to do. OUT.
