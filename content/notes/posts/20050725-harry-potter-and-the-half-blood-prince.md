# Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince

![](http://www.hpbook6.com/harrypotterbook6halfbloodprince.jpg)The sixth book by JK Rowling happens to be her second to last. At least, it is supposed to be her second to last book on Harry Potter (I got 50 bucks on that one holding). At any rate, the book is a thing of magnificence. JK flexes her writing abilities as Harry Potter and her audience grow older. Like many adult novels, this child's novel has a slightly slower pace but more mystery. The plot has a tad more twist to it than The Order of the Phoenix had to it, in fact I would liken it more to The Goblet of Fire in level of complexity. Here's a quick synopsis on the book: Harry Potter finds himself a sixth year student, a captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team, and a close assistant to Dumbledore. He also stumbles across a book of potions by the Half-Blood Prince, which helps him wonderfully in his potions class. His suspicions of Malfoy also grow to new levels, as does the "High School" drama. While he sleuths around for clues to Malfoy's plans, he trains with Dumbledore, falls in love with a new girl, and wins a few Quidditch matches. That's about it. Except for the exciting stuff. But you'll just have to read it to find out what that stuff is, won't you? But really, pick it up for yourself (considering you have read the previous ones of course) and give it a go. If you don't, I'll come to your house and slap you right across the f-in face! Out for now. More on other stuff in my life later. When? Well you'll just have to keep on visiting to find out, won't you?
