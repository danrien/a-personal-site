# So stupid it's contagious

Listening to: 'Get Up' from 'Here's To The Mourning' by 'Unwritten Law' on Media Center 11 What's up you freaks. Why in the fuck are you reading this goddamn blog? Shit. Three swear words in under two sentences (normally referred to as 1 sentences, but sometimes 1.6 sentences). Has to be a new record for me. In addition, I've seemed to have pissed off everybody reading my blog. Therefore it seems I have alienated all readership I have and therefore I can quit writing on this stupid assface diary forever. Ahhhh who am I kidding? I like writing stupid shit and sounding important. Just so you know, don't believe a single thing I say, it's most likely wrong and even more likely completely misleading. But where would be the fun if I said anything true? HmmmmmmmMMMMMM??! I came to save you but I ran for miles. Summer school is in its final throes and therefore so is my grade. I have two tests this week in Calc 2, and both of them are undroppable. Who said BSC was easy? Me? Oh yeah..... well it still is, it's just that they make you turn your brain on in the last week. Bastards. Right now I'm burning a bunch of DVD's of my friend's (aka stealing as the [Motion Picture Association of America](http://www.mpaa.org/anti-piracy/) would put it). Soon, I'll be going to party. Hopefully, if all goes as planned, I will get extremely lucky with a beautiful baby tonight too, but if that happens I'll probably be too scared anyways. Iiii-I'm done with listening To what's wrong with me Coz it goes on and on And on and on yeh. PEACE
