# The only difference is nobody can cry

Listening to: 'Cry On Demand' from 'Demolition' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11 Kinda depressed right now...... I'm not exactly sure of the direct cause, but I'm putting my odds on the song I'm listening to right now, Cry on Demand by Ryan Adams. It's phenomenal and very depressing. Anyways, the blog tips for driving revenue up told me I should stick to one topic so I'm going to talk about the shuttle launch this morning. WOW. Finally. NASA is finally getting it's act together. It all started around a year or 2 years ago when the Mars rovers successfully started their mission, and it has been made official by this launch. After some years of complacency, NASA is once again a governmental organization that is doing something. Congratulations. [Full coverage.](http://www.space.com/returntoflight/)
