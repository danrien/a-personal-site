# There is a wait so long, you'll never wait so long

Listening to: 'Debaser' from 'Pixies' by 'The Pixies' on Media Center 11 Yo what's up people. Kind of a slow moment in my life right now.... kind of depressed and whatnot. You know, the usual. But not really. Anyways, why is it that when I'm busy I wish I had some time to rest and when I have time to rest I.... goddammit I hate paradoxes. Anyways, I was as mean as possible (which isn't very mean for me, but very funny) to a lot of people at work today. It was fun and enjoyable and I hope to do it again sometime.
