# Change your heart, look around you

Listening to: 'Everybody's Gotta Learn Sometimes' from 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' by 'Beck' on Media Center 11 Yah I'm listening to this really awesome song. Makes me wonder when I'll learn, or perhaps what I have already learned. What I've been learning, God only knows, but God knows it's gotta be something good, and it's gotta be something that'll stick with me for a long time. Very uneventful the past few days, except for a few epiphanies that have struck me. The first was the name of my daughter, but obviously that doesn't matter much right now. Someday, perhaps. It's kind of weird how that struck me. I think I was literally just sitting around like I am now, and it just hit me like a rock. I must have heard the name earlier or something. Anyways, the other was I found out what kind of girl I really click with and what kind of girl I am naturally attracted to. Needless to say, they happen to be total opposites most of the time. With any luck, I'll find a girl that fits the bill in both categories, and it will be no worries. Peace
