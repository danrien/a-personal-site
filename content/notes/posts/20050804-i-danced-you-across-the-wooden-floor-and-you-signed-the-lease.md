# I danced you across the wooden floor and you signed the lease

Listening to: 'This House Is Not for Sale' from 'Love Is Hell' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11 Today I finally made a crucial move for my future, I think. I actually wrote down how I plan to market computers. It's not so big to think of how you are going to do it, but once you actually plan it out and put in writing (as opposed to keeping it in your head) you find out that it's alot easier to execute and a lot harder to forget about. Hopefully, with any luck and god willing, I won't run into obstacles or slack off on this little project. I also had work off today, except for swimming lessons. This is the second time in my life I've ever taught swimming lessons, and let me tell you, it is a lot better then my first experience. I think I actually like my 5 year olds classes the best, because I get to be a kid again and at the same time kinda be a figure for them to look up to (and whatnot). Learned how to play the song I was listening to up there (I also included a line from the song in the title). It's fantazmo. Anyways, no big thoughts or anything for you today. Come back another day.
