# Life, as we know it, is life

I found a really interesting article today (actually, Ars Technica found it for me, but c'mon). It centers around stem cell research and offers a very good counterpoint to all those right-to-life people. However, I have my own contradiction to offer: Why are so many right-to-lifers also pro-death-sentencers? Okay, maybe that question isn't as good as the one offered in this article (or good at all), so [here's the damn article](http://www.reason.com/rb/rb122204.shtml). Out.
