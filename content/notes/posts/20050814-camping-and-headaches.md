# Camping and headaches

Hey guys. I had an awesome night last night. It was Urbalation, Muffin, Bendini, Spacecraft, and me the Machine and we embarked on a night of camping out at Fish Creek. I had planned to take some pics with my phone in the morning and mobileblog them but I of course forgot. Anyways, we had a blast. We had to cut our own firewood and all that kinda good stuff. We also had very little to eat so we were hoping to spear a wild animal (or cut it down with Spacecraft's machete). So I came back and then I started recovering my computer from the disaster I wrought upon it (note to self: never resize a Windows install). I proceeded to download (um legally.... yeah) XP64 and then installed it. Boy, am I glad I didn't pay money for this. Besides being a pain in the ass to find a key for (LEGALLY!), some of my software doesn't function very well on it. In addition to this, due to the problem noted above, I lost a lot of my music collection. Thankfully, most of it was on my mp3 player, but unfortunately I'm having the hardest time getting it off of there. WHY OH WHY DOES [CREATIVE](http://www.creative.com/) SOFTWARE SUCK!?! Well I love their mp3 players and such so what the hell. Call that a paradox. So I'm currently headaching over how to get the music on to my computer (BTW I did have about 90% of the music backed up onto DVD's, but my computer won't recognize the part of the harddrive they're on). In addition, I'm working on getting my Ubuntu install back into the open, as it's currently gasping for air underneath the suffocating blanket of the damnable Microsoft. Anyways, that's all. Peace bros and sisters, um sorry if you didn't understand the last three paragraphs hopefully it meaned a little to you.
