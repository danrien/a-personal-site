# It's what I wanted

Listening to: 'El Sol' from 'Mary Star of the Sea' by 'Zwan' on Media Center 11 So how's life. Life is life. Undeniable fact, I suppose. But the question was: how is it? So far, nineteen years in (going on twenty), I would have to say it's going downhill. Why is life like this super sweet thing and then it gets progressively worse as you live longer? Is that our curse? After all, the bible says it was our quest for knowledge that led to our downfall. Was it? Is our curse the one we brought upon ourselves? Would we be happier being ignorant? Sometimes, I must answer that one "yes". After all, if we never knew that we were going to die eventually, would it bother us? If we never knew why we were sick, would it really despair us so much? Or would we keep living, just fighting it off like we did so many other things? Ah knowledge. The bible said as much: it is our ultimate enemy and our ultimate savior. WHY. If we could indeed live eternally (as the Bible says we will), then it is all okay. Our problem is solved. But just as we were [built for religion](http://www.passig.com/pic/Religion&TheBrain.htm), we were also built to wonder. And we wonder what happens if eternity doesn't exist. What happens if we just die and get buried. How sad, yet take care in the fact that your life continues in each new life you create. The life you create is your chance at assured eternity. Perhaps I think this because someone related to me is pregnant, and it shines a new light on it. God bless them. David
