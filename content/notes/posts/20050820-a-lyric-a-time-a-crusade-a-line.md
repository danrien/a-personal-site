# A lyric, A time, A crusade, A line

It seems ages ago that I was hiking my shit out of my dorm. In fact, it seems a world away, and it was, for its time. So odd, this summer seems like it was a place out of time. Seems like it never really existed even while it did. Makes me sad to see this time go, but it makes me happy to know that it may come back in another eight months.

Last night we stayed after the pool closed (after the rental from hell that stayed until 10:00 PM). We slided for what seemed forever and played chicken in the pool. Now the pool is drained and the office and bathrooms cleaned. Memory remains. See ya summer it's been good. David Vedvick, Summer 2005.
