# I went out in the rain suddenly everything changed

Listening to: 'First Day of My Life' from 'I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning' by 'Bright Eyes' on Media Center 11 Back in college. Doing the whole school thing. Sometimes, it's a little tough, I must say. However, I have developed an ability to adapt to stress and rearrange my life accordingly. For example, last night I was invited to a drunken night of Johnny Holmes (only bearable when drunk), which sounded like a lot of fun. Unfortunately, I was super tired after class and therefore I skipped it. Instead I played computer games and went to bed around 11:30. I know, most of you are thinking 11:30? That's life ladies and gentlemen, and sadly (and happily) it's the way I've been living recently. The weekends are probably where I'll really rock it out, but we'll see what happens. Anyways, sorry to Mandi and her whole crew for ditching them last night it wasn't intentional, it was just laziness and inability to really do anything. What else? Oh yes, our little roommate bonding night Sunday night. We all got drunk and bonded, Evan threw up (and Cody too I think.... or maybe Matt), and I played guitar and said mean stuff to people on MSN. You guys know how I roll ;). PEACE
