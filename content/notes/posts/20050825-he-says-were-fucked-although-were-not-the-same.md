# He says we're fucked although we're not the same

Listening to: 'Homecoming' from 'American Idiot' by 'Green Day' on Media Center 11 Short day. Easy day. I had terrorism, which fucking rocks (because it's super easy). Note to self: bring notebook next time! Well no big thoughts, all my productive brain waves seem to be wasted in class. Um.... I built a new desk.... it rocks! Only cost me 60 bones too! Anyway peace sisters and brothers. Don't lose yourself.
