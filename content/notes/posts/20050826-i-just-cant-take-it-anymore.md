# I just can't take it anymore

Listening to: 'Get Up' from 'Here's To The Mourning' by 'Unwritten Law' on Media Center 11 *BEGIN BITCHING SECTION* So, as you all very well know, I took Calculus 2 this summer and practically ruined my summer at moments because of it. I of course took this class in anticipation of taking Calculus 3 at NDSU. Unfortunately, it seems as though all the Calc 3 classes are full. Yesterday I was told there was a class offered at 12:00 pm that still had open spots. As of today, it seems those classes are full as well. Now, I understand that. However, it astounds me that the Math department cannot open up more classes. It would seem that NDSU, being a University and having many instances where people join and drop courses at seemingly random points, would have a more flexible method of adding classes when needed. You would also think that the Math department could look at the incoming sophomores from Engineering (who almost all have to take Calculus 3) and adjust the number of classes accordingly. As far as I know, the Math department currently has around thirty students waiting to get into the class. It also seems very archaic to me that a class can't accept one extra student in response to demand. For example, when I did find an open section of Math 259 (Multi-variate Mathematics, not the same as Calc 3, but close and almost fills the requirements), it happened to be at the same time as my COMM 110 class. Unfortunately, ALL OTHER COMM 110 CLASSES ARE FULL. Apparently COMM 110 classes have a capacity of TWENTY-TWO students. It's fuckin bullshit kids. Fucking BULLSHIT. *END BITCHING SECTION* So how's your day going? David
