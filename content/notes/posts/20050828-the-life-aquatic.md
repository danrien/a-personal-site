# The Life Aquatic

I just finished watching The Life Aquatic and I have to say I'm really impressed. The movie never really made me laugh out loud (except for a couple scenes), but something innately human about the movie just really struck me. I thought it was very interesting how the movie starts out with Steve Zissou being a very in-your-face whatever guy. He's just doing what he does to make money. In some ways, that may be how many of us live our lives. However, as the movie progresses, he finds out why he started doing what he does in the first place (he's an oceanographer). What adds humor to this fairly serious backdrop is the inability of the characters to correctly express themselves. At times the characters seem almost robotic but at certain points these explosions of humanity burst forth and you go "ohhhh I get why everyone likes this movie." Honestly, though, these small explanations above don't do the movie justice. You gotta see it for yourself, and I recommend you do it as soon as possible. David
