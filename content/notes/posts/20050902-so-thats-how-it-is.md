# So that's how it is

NOTE: I think I've fixed like 10 different things in this already. Any other grammatical errors and I will kill somebody. Well it's been a while, unless you count me copying and pasting the lyrics to that Zwan song the other night (drunkenly, I might add). Touche. Speaking of drunkenly, drunking, drunked, I've been doing alot of all the above the past couple days. Not too eventful, but lots of fun. The kinda fun that you don't get because it's forced, but the kinda fun you get because it's spontaneous, a riot and because it is what fun is supposed to be. Fun shouldn't be something you have to go out and search for, it's something you should be able to just do. As I look back on tonight and what's gone wrong so far, I've come to the conclusion that too many people I know are trying too hard to have fun. Coincidentally, somebody just called me. Happily, she was having fun. That wasn't forced fun. It wasn't the fun like "We got some beer so we better go have ourselves some fun" fun, she was having fun for the sake of having fun. Don't get me wrong ladies and gents, I've had plenty of nights where I've forced the fun on. But it comes down to the point where I've been having a lot of fun lately without a lot of effort, and so hopefully you know I can keep this streak going for as long as possible. It really would mean a lot to me you know.

Anyways I had some other thoughts tonite. I've been trying to get around this sick feeling in my stomach this summer. A feeling that was left over from last year in college really. I couldn't realistically grasp it or anything, but it was there and I didn't know what to do with it. Tonight I realized what it was. Some of these friends up here, they aren't real friends. They aren't the friends that I can count on if I'm dying and all I need is for them to be there. They're the friends that are my friends when they need me. When I can do something for them, they are a friend. And you know what? That's bullshit. Call me sometime when you aren't looking for somewhere to drink. When you don't need help with your computer. When can I really be you friend. Seriously. No names, just take it as it is. NOTE: I must've still been a little drunk last night because that was a little harsher than I intended. It's been changed to be a little more "politically correct." But don't ask me to take your butt plugs out. Please.
