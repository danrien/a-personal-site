# Katrina

Got some links for you guys. First of all, here's a blog by a guy who works for an internet hosting company in New Orleans. Drawing power from their backups, they almost ran out of kerosene a few hours ago. However things seem to be going better: [The Interdictor.](http://www.livejournal.com/users/interdictor) Next is the webcam they have set up. Some interesting things have happened on this in the past few days: [Webcam](http://meta.advection.net/event/adv/evt20050902/0250/). Finally, Ars Technica has listed some good ways to help out over the internet if you feel like doing so. [Here's the article](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050903-5272.html). Good luck to all!
