# Nothing that I wouldn't try

_Listening to: 'Girl' from 'Guero (Deluxe Edition)' by 'Beck' on Media Center 11_ Okay. Here's my dilemma. I don't know if I've used that title before. Doesn't matter. I'm burnt out and have had a super stressful day. Did I ever mention how much I hate stress? I would fuck this whole life of mine if I could. But sometimes destiny is too powerful. You can't escape somethings. And that's fact. Out. I'm dead and dying. How does that happen? Maybe I'll be alive and living tomorrow. We'll see.
