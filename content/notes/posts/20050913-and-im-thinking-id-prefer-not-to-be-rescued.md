# And I'm thinking I'd prefer not to be rescued.

_Listening to: 'Miss Delaney' from 'Everything In Transit' by 'Jack's Mannequin' on Media Center 11_ Life is great. Even with the horrible times I had last week, I still managed to come out of it smiling. Often I wonder, is it my lack or refusal of stress that will lead to my downfall? I won't know until it happens but my personal feelings are no, as long as I stay responsible and try to keep my head above water. If I go ahead with clear intentions, and not only intentions but a sense of responsibility, I will come out on top. Perhaps some of it is that I always forget first assignments, and last week was chock-full of first assignments, and therefore doom was unavoidable. I guess I just gotta tell myself things will look better kid. I know they will. Life has it's own patterns, and if anything is recognizable, it is that if you have a positive attitude then your life will eventually reflect that attitude. It may take some time, a few beers, and a cigarette or two, but you'll come out on top. Not to mention the guy above keeping check on things (with all hope and praise). Advice? Don't get too crazy but let yourself venture out enough to know that you aren't missing out. And don't worry if you do miss out every once in awhile. You can't be everywhere but you can be somewhere. Experience. Learn. Teach.
