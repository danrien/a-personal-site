# Comment Spam

_Listening to: 'Cold Roses' from 'Cold Roses (CD2)' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11_ Well folks I think I've finally breached the crucial layer that separated me from becoming a spam victim on my blog. I don't know if any of you have noticed it, but there has been some really weird spams on my comments lately. Such as "Your blog is really cool! Visit (insert porn site here) to see one just like it!" Nonsense like that I was deleting for a few days before I realized that it wasn't going to stop. That was when I decided to take the protective measure of turning on Comment Spam protection. What it basically does is make you type in a word from an image before you post. The reasoning is that a computer cannot read a picture (especially when it's all curvy and whatnot), and therefore spammers can't target me as easily. Sorry for the inconvenience folks. Out.
