# Ranting and Raving Time

Well folks it's official. Failing out of NDSU. Fifteen grand and four F's later it looks like I'm fucked. I have to say the ride was worth it, but unless I pull miracles out of my ass, I highly doubt I'm pulling C's in any of my math classes (i.e. all my classes). What is the problem? BURNOUT. Folks, in the past week, my mind has been focused on nothing but math, unless you count the two hours I spent studying Terrorism. And you know what? When it came to test time, I couldn't even think mathematically (or calculus-wise) and so the end result is I failed all my tests. I hope something or somebody rescues me out of this hellish hole I now call my mind.
