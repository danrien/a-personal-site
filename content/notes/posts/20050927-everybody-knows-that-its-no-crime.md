# Everybody knows that it's no crime.

_Listening to: 'Pressure' from 'Greatest Hits Volume 2 1978-1985' by 'Billy Joel' on Media Center 11_ Hello Ladies and Gents. Been busy as usual. Usually I'm busy thinking about doing something. Usually I end up doing nothing. A lot of times, I've thought about posting on here, but writer's block has finally started to hit me. Maybe it's the lack of English classes and the resulting lack of stress on that part of the brain. Anyways. WARNING: NERD TALK AHEAD Physics has been pretty sweet lately (if extremely tiring lecture-wise). Right now we're learning about electro-magnetism and the crazy thing that my friend Jared Risan noticed is that a lot of the lies I mean laws our extremely similar to the laws of mechanics and gravity. Of course these lies don't mean anything. I hate physics! END OF NERD TALK Anyways, I've been thinking of starting a new blog where I review music since I listen to it so damn much. In addition I've been thinking of asking my good friend Jordan to also post reviews on there and then we could have cool competing opinions of music up on the net. What do you think of it Jordan and my other reader(s)? MSN me and if you think it should happen or not and then I will act accordingly. Anyways, I'm outta this house peace.
