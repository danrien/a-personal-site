# Five in the morning and somewhat sane.

_Listening to: 'Oh My Sweet Carolina' from 'Heartbreaker' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11_ So it's five in the fucking morning. Sometimes, I just do not know what's wrong with me. Honestly. This weekend I slept straight through Saturday and Sunday practically and yet here I am Wednesday morning finding it impossible to be tired. My philosophy is it's all the thinking I was doing tonight, but the truth probably is that I didn't go work out and therefore didn't get tired. Real truth is there is no truth but then that's false too if that's true I guess. I finished my physics homework for once. BEFORE it was due. Is it a bad thing if the edge of the screens start to curve in on you? Oh I sure hope not. Have you fellows and madams ever read Narnia? If you have not, I highly recommend it. Why is it that my keyboard batteries haven't ran out yet? Why then, and I do hope you enlighten me, do all girls have no attraction to me (unless utterly desperate)? Am I diseased? You would think my horrible jokes would count for something. Maybe even a dash of lust for the good ol Ved. ANSWER ME. Sorry I have gone insane. Maybe I will get a few hours of sleep and trudge through tomorrow like it's yesterday. Although that would be fairly disastrous. Funny to think if I had to get up at 7 I wouldn't even question staying up the whole night. But since I could get 3 hours and 50 minutes of sleep I might just go to bed. Who knows. I wonder what four hours would do for me anyways. Chances are I would need to set a couple alarm clocks to properly wake up. Why does Ryan Adams say 'Oh I just wanna die without you'? I think I know but I can't place my finger on it. And what the hell happened on his new cd. Talk about eclectic.
