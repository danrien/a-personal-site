# Ain't it the Life

_Listening to: 'Times Like These' from 'One By One' by 'Foo Fighters' on Media Center 11_ Hey gals and dudes. The Concert I saw the band of my dreams last night, Weezer. Anyone who knows me well knows that I have followed this band for years and have been a hardcore fan for very long. While I was slightly dissapointed by their new cd, I was completely hyped for the tour. Luckily, me and Jordan Engel got some tickets to their St. Paul show. So here's the rundown: the show started around 7:30 with the Kaiser Chiefs (sweet band), and they were saying all sorts of crazy british nonsense that I couldn't translate (somebody get me a British to American dictionary!). However their music was really rockin and set the mood nicely. After a good half-hour of them playing, there was an intermission where me and Jordan bought Full Throttles and got ourselves pumped up for Weezer. I probably got too hyper, but then that was good because the alternative was hungover mood. When Weezer started playing my heart skipped a beat. The first song was My Name is Jonas and dear god it was awesome. It gets a little blurry after that, but I'm sure somebody remembers details better than me. Anyways, the highlight of the Weezer portion of the show for me was when Rivers sneaked off the stage with the rest of the band and then came to the back of the floor close to us and started playing an acoustic rendition of Island in the Sun in the middle of the crowd. GOD IT WAS FUCKING AWESOME. Then the Foos came on and blew me way for a good half hour before I settled into the show. I was so blown away that I couldn't even move. I was literally shocked at how powerful the first half hour was. They played every song I could imagine and I nearly made a mess in my pants. They had a huge guitar solo while I was taking a dump (HEY! I would've died without it!) but luckily I caught the end of it. The highlight of this portion of the show for me was the solo version of Everlong by Dave. And it was sweet when the band joined in like 3 or 4 minutes into it. Overall, I am so grateful I've had this chance to see these two phenomenal bands who I've been wishing to see for ages. One of the best concerts if not the best concert I have ever been to. David
