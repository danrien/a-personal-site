# The Turmoil May Be Ending

It's weird you know. Under 8 hours ago I was completely stressed out (on one of my least stressful days of the week), and yet here I sit completely relaxed ready for whatever tomorrow will throw at me. Maybe it's because I finally had time to sit down and strum out a few chords on my guitar. Or maybe it's the fact that Ryan Adams started playing on my computer. Or maybe it's just that that is my thing; maybe when I chill out, my mind finally frees itself. But I know this: here I sit completely relaxed without a care in the world. The sky has opened her eyes and the tears fall on the last vestiges of summer's caress as we sit here on the verge on fall and ultimately winter (which comes too soon). I don't know what it is but something about it inspired me to come up with some chords and I think I'm going to write the words right now, here for you: The campfire sits Warming our mits And all we have to do is talk As we reminisce We don't care what we miss Coz all we got to do is talk If the sky could talk She'd say to me What the hell you doin son And I tell her dear heaven: It doesn't matter If this glass here shatters Coz all I wanna do is talk I've taken my clothes I've sat on my jeans I've worn my hat And now I just want to sleep I don't really know if that will go to the chords I wrote but who in the hell cares. Each thing is its own and for what I've created here, something else will go along just as beautiful to the guitar (if this doesn't, which I'm really hoping it does). Anyways, as I stand outside my life sort of right now I think I'm realizing I'm finally in the swing. I can kind of relax. And fuck me if I'm not thankful. Peace, love and all that good shit David
