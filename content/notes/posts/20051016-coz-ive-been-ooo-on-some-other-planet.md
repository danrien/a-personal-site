# Coz I've been ooo-on some other planet

_Listening to: 'Landed' from 'Songs for Silverman' by 'Ben Folds' on Media Center 11_ Wow what a weekend. I am sorry people gave up on my promises for a weekend. It was all for friendship. Hopefully it doesn't screw me over tomorrow on my test....... Updates tomorrow.......
