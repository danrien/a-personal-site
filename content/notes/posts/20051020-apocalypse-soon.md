# Apocalypse Soon?

Listening to: '12 - Death Or Glory' from 'London Calling' by 'The Clash' on Media Center 11 

What's up my fellows. I'm trying to make a post with this new Flock browser to see how it works out. I'll tell you about Flock in a post after this though. 

So my title. I was [reading an interesting article on MSNBC](http://g.msn.com/0MN0RS9/3?http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9731623/&&CE=3032091) about people's speculation on the forthcoming apocalypse. Surely, the oncoming Avian flu outbreak, the wealth of natural disasters and so forth are a great cause for concern. Indeed, they could be directly linked to two of the four horsemen of the apocalypse (damn I hate typing that word).

What do I think? Well you know what, I've decided to hold back on judgement. I don't think the apocalypse will happen so quickly if it were to happen. I tend to think that it would take some time. But you know what? I decided that all I can do if the apocalypse really holds true (it is of some debate among theologians whether the apocalypse is metaphorical or literal) is to just hold my faith in God. 

I mean, what else can one do? I certainly like to think this world isn't beyond rescue, or that there is something we can do to survive, but really if it's true that this world holds to a destiny, then I guess I just got to do what Revelations (and the rest of the Bible, mind you) says to do: believe in God and Jesus (and if not Jesus, please at least believe in some form of higher authority, really it's the least you could do). If that pans out then hopefully I get into heaven.

The way I look at it, I just got to do my best to be a good human being, spreading kindness and happiness through the world. If I can manage to do that, then I'll feel like I'm a better human being in the end whether or not heaven and hell exist. Still, I got to say I do believe in God (although I am of the Catholic wing that doesn't take the bible literally, which explains my belief in evolution, but I still adhere to its word).

If you don't got something to believe in, then how are you supposed to go on? 

By the way this Flock thing needs some work the theme for it is really annoying and distracting right now.

**[Anonymous](#48 "2005-10-24 18:09:00"):** LOL IF EVOLUTION WAS TRUE YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE DINOSAURS THAT ENDED UP EVOLVING INTO BIRDS WOULD HAVE DIED BEFORE THEIR WINGS BECAME CAPABLE OF FLIGHT I MEAN IT WOULD BE PRETTY ACKWARD FOR DINOSAURS RUNNING AROUND WITH HALF FORMED WINGS TO RUN AROUND AND SURVIVE AND STUFF, YET NATURAL SELECTION WAS KINDER TO THEM THAN THE REAL DINOSAURS? WEIRD STUFF MAN ALSO FISH THAT DEVELOPED FEET: HALF DEVELOPED FEET ARE A HINDRANCE TO AQUATIC LIFE, SO WHY WOULD FISH START DEVELOPING FEET? IT ONLY MAKES SENSE IF YOU CAN GO FROM FISH WITH NO FEET TO FISH WITH FEET OVER THE COURSE OF JUST A FEW GENERATIONS, THERE IS NO WAY FISH WITH HALF DEVELOPED FEET WOULD CONTINUE TO EXIST FOR THE THOUSANDS OF GENERATIONS NECESSARY TO FULLY EVOLVE. SORRY FOR THE SERIOUS TOPIC OF MY COMMENT TODAY, I OBIOUSLY AM NO EXPERT ON THIS TOPIC JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT PERSONALLY I PROMOTE NATURAL SELECTION AS FAR AS IMPROVEMENT OF THE GENE POOL GOES (FOR EXAMPLE NEW GENERATIONS OF DEER BEING FASTER THAN THE PREVIOUS, AS THE SLOW DEER GET KILLED PRIOR TO PROCREATION), BUT MUTATIONS CREATING NEW SPECIES OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS IS ONE OF THE MOST UNLIKELY THEORYS I'VE EVER COME ACROSS LOL O YA AND IF U AREN'T IN HEAVEN WE MIGHT AS WELL ALL NOT GO I MEAN WHAT'S THE POINT FOR REAL
