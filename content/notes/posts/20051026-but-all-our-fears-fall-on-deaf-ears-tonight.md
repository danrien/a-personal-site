# But all our fears fall on deaf ears tonight

_Listening to: 'Several Ways to Die Trying' from 'A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar' by 'Dashboard Confessional' on Media Center 11_ I've now gotten my results for two tests that I took last week. Outcome? Not as good as I had hoped, but at least they weren't total bombs (compared to the rest of my tests so far this year). On my Discrete Mathematics test, I managed to get 67%. A little under the class average, but not abysmal. It also doesn't help that I couldn't find the practice test that I had planned to study with (of course, I found about 2 days after the test). Fortunately, I have a second test that could raise that average. At any rate, all I need to make it by in the class is a D, but I plan on doing much better if at all possible. On my linear algebra, I got 78%. Very good result, but it could've easily been so much better. Unfortunately, I somehow missed a whole problem and therefore lost about 13% of a grade. Even worse, it was an easy problem. For heaven's sake honestly. Somebody give me a break here. Anyways, might go up to Grand Forks on Friday night, if I can manage. Apparently there's going to be a sweet Halloween kegger up there or something. I doubt Fargo will be doing much. This city sleeps on the weekends.
