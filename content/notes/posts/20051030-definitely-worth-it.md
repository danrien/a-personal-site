# Definitely worth it...

_Listening to: 'Impromptu in C sharp minor, Op. 66' from '100 Piano Masterpieces (Disc 2)' by 'Frederic Chopin' on Media Center 11_ That was one of the best tea parties I've ever been to. Nothing more to say. Oh yeah almost forgot, my most recent physics derivation: (hot girls+halloween) = (david dead from shock) David
