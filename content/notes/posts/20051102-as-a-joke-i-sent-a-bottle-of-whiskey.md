# As a joke, I sent a bottle of whiskey

_Listening to: 'Life On A Chain' from 'musicforthemorningafter' by 'Pete Yorn' on Media Center 11 _ ![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6155/868/320/DSCN1736.jpg) That was ONE of the moments this weekend. tODAY i'M GOING TO TALK INVERTED. Nevermind, that was super annoying and distracting. Anyways, there's my fully naked friend Hammerhead taking the garbage out. Yeah I know ladies, back off. He's my friend and he's not getting laid ANYMORE. So ahhh, what did we do? Well I dressed up as a carpenter/something (along with my buds Constrictor and Muffin). Someone started calling me Bob the Builder and I guess it stuck.

![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6155/868/320/bob_1024.jpg) Um, I think all my friends got on some chicks except for me, but whatever. It really comes down to the fact that I see a girl and I can just see the personality getting sucked out of her. And sadly the one's who do have personality I'm too much of a pussy to talk to, so I guess I'm just a moron. But seriously, ladies if you want me, you gotta have a sick personality. But then again, maybe I should just take whatever I can get. I mean, 20 year old virgin? They could almost make a movie out of me. Hopefully I don't turn into that one movie.....anyways, I'm putting an end to this.....wait what was the question again? Oh yeah, why don't I get laid? I guess I'll do what all the girls say and "save it for someone special." Who am I kidding? \- Dave
