# And from the burning building where I lay, as I watched the stars become the day....

_Listening to: 'Mfeo' from 'Everything In Transit' by 'Jack's Mannequin' on Media Center 11_ It's my weekly sunday night post and to tell the truth it's kind of pointless. I mean there's nothing much to talk about these days. Umm let's see... homework, test, homework, another test, my life just becomes this boring collage of me doing school work and as the alternative doing nothing. Guess I got some programs working in my Ubuntu Linux install (it's an operating system like Windows). That was kind of satisfying in a nice nerdy fashion that I haven't felt for ages. I did buy a CD this weekend. I bought the cd above, Everything in Transit by Jack's Mannequin. Jack's Mannequin is a cool side project by Andrew McMahon of Something Corporate. It seems really personal and it makes me a happier and better man whenever I listen to it. So if you see me with a wide ol' grin on my face and a jump in my step, no it's not because I got laid it's because I'm listening to this dude. I also just recently saw a crazy movie called Trainspotting. It was shot in the early 90's and is about a heroine addict and his friends. To say the least, it's fucking badass. Shit goes so screwy all the time that I just got fucked up watching it. Quote: "Imagine your best group orgy and take that times ten and it's not half as good [in reference to heroine]." Kinda scary huh? Um there's not really too much more to say. My skin is starting to change from this summer. The crazy thing about my skin is that it doesn't just naturally shed like most people's, it sticks on in spots. Don't ask me the thing I go through to get it off. Just kidding I just scrub it off. Anyways low on flow low on friends but high on life. Shit yeh. (That was really cheesy)
