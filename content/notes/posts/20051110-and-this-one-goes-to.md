# And this one goes to

all the girls who ever loved me.... you know who you are, all zero of you ;) The Format â€” On Your Porch 

> I was on your porch, the smoke sank into my skin so i came inside to be with you and we talked all night, about everything We could imagine cause come the morning ill be gone and as our eyes start to close i turn to you and i let you know that i Love you well my dad was sick and my mom she cared for him her love it nursed him back to life and me i ran, i couldnt even Look at him for fear id have to say goodbye and as i start to leave he grabs me by the shoulder and he tells me whats left To lose, youve done enough and if you fail well then you fail but not to us cause these last three years, i know theyve been Hard but now its time to get out of the desert and into the sun even if its alone so now here i sit, in a hotel off of Sunset my thoughts bounce off of sams guitar and thats the way its been, ever since we were kids but now, now weve got Something to prove and i, i can see there eyes but tell me something, can they see mine cause whats left to lose, ive done Enough and if i fail well then i fail but i gave it a shot and these last three years, i know theyve been hard but now its Time to get out of the desert and into the sun even if its alone i was on your porch last nite, the smoke it sank into
