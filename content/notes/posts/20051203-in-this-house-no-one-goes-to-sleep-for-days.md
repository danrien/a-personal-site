# In this house, no one goes to sleep for days

_Listening to: '29' from '29' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11_

![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6155/868/320/Ryan%20Adams%20-%2029.jpg)It's nearly midnight in Fargo on a Saturday night and here I sit at my computer typing up a blog post. I mean, I should be up and about partying this town to all hell, what with only two more weekends left before finals. But you know what? Fuck it. I can't afford to drink, academically or financially. And so I arrive to the point that I'm at now. Not that I wouldn't mind going to a party or something, meeting people and shit. But what can I do really. Nobody calls me and God knows I don't feel like calling people. This morning I woke up at 11:30. That means I slept past my alarm which regularly explodes at 9:00 a.m. every morning. Guess that means I was tired. I've been listening to Ryan Adam's new CD, 29 recently. Technically, it doesn't come out for another 18 days, but I decided to download it illegally. It's what I do. Needless to say, it is amazing. It also somehow happens to be his best release yet this year. I just find it amazing that he can pump out so many good songs. Imagine if Rivers Cuomo just decided to put out a bunch of his shit. Then this world would have two prolific singer songwriters running around (the more the better I say). Around the apartment the big news recently has been Need for Speed Underground on my Gamecube. Practically everybody and their mother has been playing it, and it hasn't been little five minute sessions. Oh no, we're all putting in serious game time. Think around 6 to 8 hours a day. Finally, we have something to bond us all together. And just so Jordan knows, I'm the best one at the game in the apartment. And we play it on the GAMECUBE. Take that Jordan. As for the past week, it was definitely rougher than usual. I turned in two incomplete assignments that I probably put a total of ten hours into combined. It was slightly depressing, but on the bright side I learned alot more about what I'm doing. Now the only challenge is to do those things right on the test. Anyways, I'm out for another short while. Good luck kids. 

Blue sky, when you goin to learn to rain? Let yourself go blue for once, Let go of that pain.
