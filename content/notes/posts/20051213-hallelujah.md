# Hallelujah

_Listening to: 'Just Another' from 'musicforthemorningafter' by 'Pete Yorn' on Media Center 11 _Sometimes, life just seems so slow. Here I sit hopefully ready for both a Discrete Math test and a Physics test that I'm going to take later today, and yet I just feel like everything is just going slowly. I mean, God knows tomorrow my life will be a hectic mess until 3 PM but for some reason that seems right. Right now, I just don't know what to do. I don't know whether to go to sleep, study, or just take it easy, keep on typing. Instinct tells me, keep on typing. Maybe I need this break. Unfortunately, I've been telling myself that a lot over the past few days. Maybe you need this break, you could use a break, just relax. Somehow, I think it might backfire. But at the same time, I know I've done alot of studying. Maybe not as much as I could've done, but at the same time, I feel as though I'm prepared as I'll ever be for tomorrow. So as I was just telling my friend Jordan, I made this new amazing playlist of songs that just relaxes me. After I told him, he proceeded to suggest new songs I should put on there. For a moment of clarity between the two of us, I must say this: first of all, I've been modifying this playlist for the past 24 plus hours in order to make it into the state of perfection it is in now. Secondly, I think it is important that a playlist of music be what it needs to be to you and not to somebody else. That is why suggestions in this sort of business are just completely unneeded and unasked for. That would be like me taking suggestions about what to write in this blog. I mean, fuck you, I'll write whatever the hell I want to here. This is where I get to express myself, perhaps in a way that some may call "creatively." Figured I should clarify that, I think it's an important lesson for people. People generally do what works out for them, and if they try to do what others want done, it usually doesn't work out well. Your mind just needs these sorts of releases, ways to rush some endorphins into the brain without eating food or taking a pull of liquor. Not that those aren't needed either, but variation is what keeps your brain and your soul healthy. Maybe. But baby, I've been here before. I've seen this room, and I've walked this floor. ~ Jeff Buckley, "Hallelujah"
