# Hmm, what'd you say, mmm, that you only meant well?

![](http://photo.sing365.com/music/picture.nsf/Imogen-Heap-photo/48256C71003578A248256A8D0023FA9D/$file/imogen-heap.jpg)You know what's been one of the most fascinating aspects of my musical life the past few months? The discovery of good female artists in the alt/indie scene. Pictured to my right is Imogen Heap, of the Frou Frous, and singer of the climactic song "Hide and Seek" from the last episode of season 2 of the OC. Crazy. Anyways, for the observational of you, you might notice that I'm making this post at 4:45 a.m. Why? Well, I kind of drank like 3 cups of coffee before my bedtime tonight, and so here I am, unable to sleep three and a half hours before my Terrorism test. Luckily, I'm not too concerned about being able to keep it together; the test is so early that my test taking ability won't be affected by my lack of sleep. It's kind of funny how that goes. I think I'm going to start a new tradition in writing where I have a quick follow up to my previous paragraph as the first sentence of the new paragraph. Interesting concept, but I think it will over all make these discussions much more like discussions, instead of me just blabbering. Okay, I'll still be blabbering but who the hell cares? I'm not asking you to read this, but dear god do I love it when you do. Especially when you guys tell me that it's really good and stuff. Sorry for using lots of "you's", I know it goes against all proper etiquette, but I can't help myself. I've noticed something very interesting over the past few days. In the series of four speeches that Mr. Bush has been giving (isn't it sad that we have to look forward to our president giving speeches?), he has taken a much more apologetic tone to the American people. I for one have to say that I appreciate him saying that it was his ultimate decision that led us into Iraq. Taking responsibility for what you did wrong is something that all kids should learn at some point. Mr. Bush is no different. That poor sucker, he has no idea what he's doing in that desk, I mean at least Clinton got ...erm... "stuff" done there. But seriously kids, I think America needs to calm the hell down. There's no way we're going to leave Iraq in a year, and my best estimate would put us at half the troop strength we have there now by 2007. Really, that's not too far off, and we've sacrificed alot more human lives for a lot lesser causes. Spanish-American War, anyone? I mean, even Vietnam had more reasoning behind it than that war. Pff, Vietnam. Anyways, I still would say I'm a Democrat, and while I disagree with the war, and our reasons for going there, I'm not some block-headed idiot from New York who thinks we should leave Iraq tomorrow, and in its present state. For better or worse, we got into this, and we have to stick it through. And what the hell, something good may come of it. Anyways, I'm done ranting and maybe I'll post in an hour or so to stay awake. Peace. ~ David Vedvick
