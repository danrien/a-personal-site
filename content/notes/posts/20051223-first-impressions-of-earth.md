# First Impressions of Earth

_Listening to: 'Juicebox' from 'First Impressions Of Earth' by 'The Strokes' on Media Center 11_ I am nearing the end of my first week in Bismarck. First of all, I would like to apologize to dear old BismarckND for slandering it. I did not mean most of what I said. Except for the "fuck you Bismarck" part. I meant every single letter of that. Not Really! Seriously though I've been having a lot of fun doing pretty much nothing. I've found out that it has been an incredible stress reliever and I haven't missed partying yet (although I'm bound to drink one of these nights). The way I figure it, everyone will probably party like crazy while I'm gone doing PRACS studies and then when I get back everyone will figure it out and not wanna drink. I've decided that I must be the problem, maybe I'm a bad drunk or something. ;) This means that I might have to stick to drinking by myself and being all lonely and drunk and stuff, but I'm pretty good at that. It also means I'll have to stick to drinking on weekdays, which are the worst moments to drink since it means I'll be hungover for homework or school the next day. Maybe I'll pull of some crazy fiasco like I did last spring and not drink for just about ever. Or maybe not. We'll see how the money looks. Anyways, enough about myself. How about you?
