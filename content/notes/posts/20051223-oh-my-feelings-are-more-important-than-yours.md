# Oh, my feelings are more important than yours

Well this is a shocker! Two posts in one night! Guess I'm just feeling the literary bone in me tonight. Or maybe I'm just that bored. Anyways, I was having some cool thoughts, and my computer's right here, so I thought about putting them up. I was just thinking about how lucky I am to have lived the life I have. To have had the friends I have had, the experiences I've experienced, and to have done what I've done. I find it astonishing that some people live life feeling like they've never lived it the fullest. Me, I could die tomorrow and feel like I've lived one of the greatest lives ever lived. That certainly doesn't mean I don't want to live beyond tomorrow, I would love to. I would love to experience more, live more. Be happier than I am now. I think it's important that we all take moments to be grateful for our friends and our family and the rest of our support network. I mean this world sucks no doubt about it. The whole place is going to shit as far as I'm concerned. But I'm here and I've been given this incredible chance to do so many things. Maybe I haven't done as much as everyone else, and maybe I haven't had the friends that everyone has had. But I feel like I've lived one of the most fortunate and happy lives, and people call me unlucky. Think of how much luck we must have had just to survive and to have lived in the first place! Anyways, I was also thinking I should point something out. I've put some new ads on this site that you've probably noticed. I've actually found them useful, since I choose what to advertise, and I've decided that I will advertise only stuff that interests me and my friends. Anyways, go ahead and click on something if it interests you, you don't need to fear feeding the big corporate dogs because you're feeding me and possibly staving off me selling my body to PRACS.
