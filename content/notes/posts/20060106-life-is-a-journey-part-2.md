# Life is a Journey, Part 2

So we come to the point where Christmas vacation is nearly over. Have I accomplished anything over vacation? Yes, and no. No, because in any sort of material sense I didn't accomplish any goals; I didn't finish anything, I didn't even start anything. However, I must take into consideration what I accomplished emotionally. I realized last night (which would be Wednesday night) that I had hit a low point in my life this Christmas. While I was certainly happy, it wasn't the happy like "Yay-I'm-happy-because-I've-done-so-much" but more the "I'm-happy-because-I-don't-have-to-do-so-much" which is really depressing if you don't know. And I definitely hit rock bottom last night and it sucked and I don't want to be there for ever. You know everybody's always turning a new leaf (especially in the New Year's season), and I've always thought that's kind of bullshit. In the end, the hardest thing to change is who you are, and I definitely don't know if I can do that. Shit, I've been trying to change who I am for the past 19+ years. But God, shit he knows that I can't change who I am. So where am I going with this? Well, it's time to start taking a new approach to solving problems. Instead of trying to change the very person you are, why not just add in new things to help alleviate the symptoms? Find ways to help yourself out, but don't try to change the way your brain works. Because if you do that, you'll go crazy, and trust me that's not a fun place to be (not that I've ever been crazy....). Anyways, I think it's time for my end-of-Christmas-break apologies to everyone I didn't see. Whoever you are, you know you rule and kick ass and generally don't suck, but if you do, that's cool too because I'm sure you're serving some purpose. God bless. David
