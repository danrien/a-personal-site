# On the subject of a hangover as I recieve one

_Listening to: 'Carry On My Wayward Son' by 'Kansas' on Media Center 11_ It has been my distinct pleasure to drink the past two nights, however, it has been with some regret that I have recieved hangovers the following days. I felt the need, after watching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas tonight, to attempt to explain what I feel in a hangover. A hangover for me doesn't come with the well talked over headache that so many people complain about. Actually, most mornings after a night of excessive drinking I find myself feeling like I just won the lottery. Why I get this feeling of euphoria, I can't explain. However, I know that the day is all downhill from there. For the most part, the rest of my day is a haze, where I feel intensely unable to do a single thing. It is as if all ambition has left my body and been replaced by a laziness only seen in potheads. While it is not out of the question that I'll achieve something (and indeed, I might accomplish more than I do on a normal day), I definitely know that I won't accomplish any of the simple tasks: for example, I have put off getting the (now molding, I'm sure) left over sausage out of my car. Most would explain this away as laziness. However, I am not known for the extent of torpidness it takes to not accomplish a simple task such as the one described above, and this is how I know it is a result of drinking. Indeed, I would not be writing this right now had I not just entered the stage after a hangover, where the feeling to get done all the stupid little things that I let slide in the past few days takes command of my mind and I enter a state of busy-ness that I am most definitely not known for either. You may not find it interesting, however I think that you who read this should know that if I seem extremely lax on certain days then it is most certainly due to copious amounts of drinking the night(s) before. Comments are appreciated. Peace.
