# Booze, Ryan Adams, and other common mixtures in my life

_Listening to: 'Strawberry Wine' from '29' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11_ So it comes to be the 7th Day in February already of 2006, and here I sit reflecting on my life. These moments I guess need doing, and all apologies if you poor readers get the brunt of my reflections. Where I left off last time was the Grand Forks incident. That's now taken place nearly 2 or 3 weeks ago, and so I guess an update on the happenings in my life is due before I start reflecting. A week and a half ago I got so drunk I don't remember missing a chair and falling on the floor. So be the power of whiskey over me, which will surely destroy me someday. More on that later. Oh yeah lately I've been reading The Count of Monte Cristo, excellent read. Reading it on my Palm z22. So reflecting. I guess what it came down to was a quarter of a bottle of whiskey and a cigarette, which got me kind of feeling shitty. Then we happened to almost get busted at my buddy's dorm. The reason behind me feeling shitty is selfish and stupid, but in some sense they deserve talking about. My real reason is that I wanted to fucking have fun that night and sadly, in Fargo everybody drinks to drink. I drink to have fun, but I guess that's a problem. I stopped drinking to drink the summer after I graduated (from high school, obviously), and I guess that's where I really collide with most Fargo people. This got me to thinking that I'm not really happy in this town, mostly because I feel that the attitude around here is really juvenile in some instances (although it definitely isn't in the school sense, maybe that's why drinking is approached so differently here). I don't know I guess I'm just always looking for a good time, with or without drinking (preferably with drinking). I'm not saying I don't want to get shitty drunk, hell I do, but I want to have fun while doing it, which I just find tough to accomplish around here (except at Mandi's parties... ;)). Anyways, just a realization that I have a hard time truly having a good time around here. And realizing that it's going to take work to find true happiness in this town of drizzle. David E. Vedvick.
