# You fit the description of a criminal crosser, and that is your flaw

_Listening to: 'Just Like Larry' from 'Who Are We Living For' by 'Dispatch' on Media Center 11_ So I decided I'd make tonight a fun post. Recently, I've been listening to absolutely massive amounts of Ryan Adams. I know, you say "IMPOSSIBLE!", but indeed all things are possible ([except for evolution](http://www.venganza.org/)). Why be this? I happened to just recently join one of the greatest communities on the internet the [Ryan Adams Archive](http://www.ryanadamsarchive.com/). These people are nuts, and only because they are crazier than me. This community posts heaps of collections of files of unreleased demos, live shows, etc. just for crazy RA fans like me. They're also crazy enough to start their own internet radio station, [Ryan Adams Radio](http://www.ryanadamsradio.com). That's for all of you who are still sort of sane and only like to listen to Ryan Adams every once in a while. At any rate, you'll always find something good playing. Sooooo I've been working out and shit it feels so good, and I'd be lying to you if I said it didn't feel good. Got a D on my first linear algebra test, probably did "okay" on my statics test (unfortunately), and am still waiting back on my ECE111 test results. I probably failed it, so what does it matter anyways, huh? Anyways, school is depressing so let's not focus on that. I plan on getting shit faced sometime this weekend I think. I don't really know why either. Supposed to be absolutely frigid tomorrow. And I'm scared. PEACE OUT. HOMEYS. LOVE AND PEACE AND ALL THAT GREASE.
