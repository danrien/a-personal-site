# Which will you take now, if you won't take me?

_Listening to: 'Which Will' from 'Pink Moon' by 'Nick Drake' on Media Center 11_ The last time I have felt this good was so long ago I can't place the event in my head. It is odd, because I will very likely not remember the feeling tomorrow, which is sad, but I guess it's all a result of the whole brain process and endorphins and shit... you gotta love pain feeling good. Let's see.... update on some things I mentioned last week: I did only do "okay" on the Statics test. I failed the ECE111 test like I supposed I would. However, not as badly as I thought I would. It looks like when all is said and done I might come out above a 50%, which I don't consider too bad considering how long after the class was over I took the test, and how much I studied for it. Sadly, it is true what they say: "You only get out of something what you put into it," and it is this simple axiom that reveals much of the needless suffering I and others undergo daily. I'm going to play another round of Mario Kart: DS online before I crash, but I'm trying to establish a semi-healthy sleep cycle so I can generally be in better condition, so I plan on sleeping at approximately 1:45 am. Good luck to you kids. I'll see ya round. David.
