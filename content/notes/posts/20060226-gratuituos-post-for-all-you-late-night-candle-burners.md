# Gratuituos post for all you late night candle burners.

_Listening to: 'Folsom Prison Blues' from 'The Best Of Johnny Cash' by 'Johnny Cash' on Media Center 11_ Well I return tonight because I felt like I had to leave you kind people with some actual words. Friday night I drank so much I blacked out and woke up puking. Exciting. Anyways, that was good and stuff but it meant Saturday I just hung out, recovered, and watched The Pianist, which I didn't really enjoy until the last 30 minutes. The scene where he plays piano for the German officer is amazing. Whoever is really playing the piano is fucking psycho that simple. I've been playing the guitar alot lately. I don't know why, I've just hungered for it. Videogames too, oddly enough. I hardly play videogames, despite what some of you may think. Back to the guitar yeah I've been hammering out some cool shit. I've also been learning more Ryan Adams, which is definitely influencing what I make up on my own too. Maybe I feel like doing all this stuff more because I've been working out. That would be really tight if my urges to do all this stuff was influenced by something so simple. I guess when you're accomplishing something in the gym you just want to take that feeling home and accomplish something there too. I hope I can get my mic up here from B-town and maybe record some voice-overs for some of my guitar nonsense. You can count on it being generally shitty, but who knows some of it may end up sounding good, at least that would be my hope. I'm going to watch a movie or something and zone out. I've been staring at this computer screen for a long ass time and I need to do something even less involving. I'll do my preliminary speech outline tomorrow morning. David.
