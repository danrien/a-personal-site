# I got a house full of walls/And utility bills, every Monday the company calls

![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6155/868/320/Ryan%20Adams%20-%20Jacksonville%20City%20Nights.jpg)_Listening to: 'Dear John' from 'Jacksonville City Nights' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11_ Thank god this guy has Ryan Adams huh? Good chance I'd go mad or something if I couldn't listen to his music 24/7. That's all for now. Creativity and urge to say anything useful is at an all time low right now. Maybe somebody can help me out.
