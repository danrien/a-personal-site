# Thanks.

![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6155/868/320/Wilco%20-%20Yankee%20Hotel%20Foxtrot.jpg)_Listening to: 'Ashes Of American Flags' from 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' by 'Wilco' on Media Center 11_ Well I think I officially had the best weekend ever. We ended up having a huge double kegger at my friends' house. For that, I need to thank Mandi, Carrie, Shannon, and Chelsi for lending me their place. And I also need to apologize for catching them by surprise when we showed up earlier than we had agreed on. Anyways, yeah the kegger was fuckin rockin everyone had a killer time I hope. We were all good and drunk and you can't ask for anything better than that. Oh yeah thanks to all of you crazy nuts who drove from out of town to come and get wasted with me! You guys and girls seriously made me the happiest man alive. And of course thanks Fargo-ites. I know Fargo can have some pretty sad weekends and hopefully I livened this one up. On a slightly more mellow tone, I've been listening to Wilco's 2002 CD Yankee Hotel Foxtrot alot and it is so good. Like an orgasm in my ears. So I'll leave you with that. Wilco - "I'm the Man Who Loves You" 

> All I can see is black and white And white and pink with blades of blue That lay between the words I think on a page I was meaning to send to You I couldn't tell if it'd bring my heart The way I wanted when I started Writing this letter to you But if I could you know I would Just hold your hand and you'd understand I'm the man who loves you All I can be is a busy sea Of spinning wheels and hands that feel for Stones to throw and feet that run but Come back home It made no difference Ever known, it made no difference Ever known to me But if I could you know I would Just hold your hand and you'd understand I'm the man who loves you All I can see is black and white And white and pink with blades of blue That lay between the words I think on a page I was meaning to send to You I couldn't tell if it'd bring my heart The way I wanted when I started Writing this letter to you But if I could you know I would Just hold your hand and you'd understand If I could you know I would Just hold your hand and you'd understand If I could you know I would Just hold your hand and you'd understand I'm the man who loves you I'm the man who loves you I'm the man who loves you I'm the man who loves you
