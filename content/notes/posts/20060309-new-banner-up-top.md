# New banner up top

_Listening to: 'Idiots Rule The World' from 'The Suicide Handbook' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11_ Well I finally put a new banner up. This one won't last forever (I'll probably put the Firefox one back up eventually), but I found it rather noble to put this banner up for those of you affected by Sony's idea of "copy protection". First off, what is copy protection? It is a method stamped onto a CD that either inhibits a computer from copying music or inhibits a computer from reading music period. Sometimes, this will be in the form of certain built-in "scratches" that prevent a CD-Rom drive from reading a CD. Other times, you will be required to install "software" in order to listen to your music on your computer. This "software" (otherwise known as a trojan horse), prohibits your computer from copying the CD, and instead lets you copy copy-protected WMA files to your hard drive that were pre-ripped and copied to the CD in the factory. The latter method is what Sony chose to do with a [select few CDs](http://www.sonybmgcdtechsettlement.com/CDList.htm) (click the link to see the full, rather lengthy, list of affected CDs). However, the copy-protection software that Sony makes you install does several malicious things, such as copy itself into your rootkit, which provides a backdoor for Sony (or a hacker) to access your computer. Unfortunately, until the lawsuit, it was illegal to remove this software or circumvent it due to restrictions put into the DMCA ([more information](http://www.eff.org/IP/DMCA/) on the Digital Millenium Copyright Act). However, for once the big companies lost, and Sony has now been ordered by the courts to repay the victimized consumer with several different options. It's more than I want to type about here, so I'll let the EFF do the explaining for you. But seriously, if you're a reader here, and you buy a lot of discs, and some happen to be recent Sony discs, then I highly suggest you take a look at the EFF's site. Good luck.
