# So happy together....

I just finished watching the story, Adaptation. Funny, it seems like I can identify with Charles Kaufman sometimes. Anyways, if you wonder why I haven't been posting much lately it's because I am dreadfully sick, and I don't know why. If you have any explanation for the symptoms other than the one I can provide, please tell me. Here they are: dizziness, achiness, wretched cough, sinus headache, horribly sore back. The diagnosis: sinuses most likely. You see, sinuses throw off your balance if they get severe enough. Not too complain, but I've become rather used to them over the course of my lifetime. I guess the best way to deal with this problem is to just ignore it the best I can and hope to the dear lord that it goes away somehow. My next treatment is going to be working out. For some reason, this always seems to cure the ailment. Unfortunately, I can't cure it right away because it is extremely hard to breathe initially (due to the sinuses clogging my nose). I theorize that the problem may only be solved this way because after my sinus problems leave, there's a lot of sore muscles from the stress my body goes under in getting rid of the sinuses. Oh, and here's the thing about Adaptation, that poor Kaufman didn't realize. The problem with a human is that he's always trying to justify some inner conflict being caused by his surrounding environment. It's true, it's psychology, and like Tom Cruise, "I've studied psychology!". But really I think my psychology book said that. So the whole challenge for a man (or woman for that matter; women just show their self-conciousness better) is to overcome this need to blame everything on the environment, and instead just fucking overcome the problem. Anyways, I've decided to go a little crazy this summer, do stupid shit. Not drugs and booze, I'm just talking about crazy shit. Not quite sure what that means yet but we'll find out. I never fall back on a promise if I can help it.
