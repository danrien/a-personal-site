# Sometimes it feels like the world is falling asleep

![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6155/868/320/The%20Strokes%20-%20First%20Impressions%20Of%20Earth%20%28Advance%29.jpg)_Listening to: 'Ize Of The World' from 'First Impressions Of Earth' by 'The Strokes' on Media Center 11_ I decided it was time to give this CD a real review. I kind of gave it a shitty initial impression, but I have to say, this is definitely one of those CDs that matures with time. The sad thing for The Strokes is that their style was so well-defined before this CD that to hear something a little different is pretty disconcerting. But I'm done being disconcerted, and I like what I hear. This CD is gritty, harsh, rough and shows The Strokes' lead singer Julian Casablancas true emotions better than any of their previous CDs. There's a good chance I'll buy it and you should too. Oh and download Arctic Monkeys and put it in a mix with this CD. Good stuff.
