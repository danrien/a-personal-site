# I'm just writing coz I f-in like it so much

_Listening to: 'One Plus One Is One' from 'One Plus One Is One' by 'Badly Drawn Boy' on Media Center 11_ Man. Life is good. Well, not all the time. But then you gotta expect shit like that to happen sometimes. To be honest, I don't know why all these endorphins are firing off in my head but hell, I might as well enjoy it while I can. Maybe it's because I'm going to be super depressed tomorrow. Hopefully not that would just put a whole damper on the happiness thing. What really shocks me is that I even do this shit. Writing about my personal life? Hell I've spoken less in one day than I'll probably write today. I've been eating seeds like crazy the past couple days. Made a sandwich tonight and it blew me away. I think my mouth almost exploded when it felt all the tastebuds rising up to celebrate all the good tastes they were experiencing. I even heard some of the male taste buds got a little too drunk at the after party and took some of the female taste buds home for a good one night stand. Some other taste buds stumbled around in the bottom of my mouth until they passed out and died right beside the molars. Anyways. I was listening to this song and it's really powerful. It's called Popstars, it's by Rooney, and here are the words for the chorus: 

> These are the words of the popstars These are the words of the unsophisticated money machines For the killers of rock and roll

And with that, I'm out. Davey.
