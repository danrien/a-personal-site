# Red Hot Chili Peppers:  Stadium Arcadium

![](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6155/868/320/Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20-%20Stadium%20Arcadium.jpg)Listening to: 'Snow (Hey Oh)' from 'Stadium Arcadium' by 'Red Hot Chili Peppers' on Media Center 11 It's about time. Yes, the Red Hot's have released a new CD (well technically, it comes out next tuesday but who's counting legality in this post?), and let me tell you, it is worth every single penny it costs when it comes out Tuesday. The amazing thing about this CD is not the lyrics or the drums or the bass (they're all good, by the way), but John Frusciante on the guitar. His riffs have to be some of the sickest I've heard in a forever. I literally salivate when I listen to him play, only because I wish to some extent that that could be me. Don't get me wrong, Keidis' words still fly out at you like a furious bundle of emotions, something that most singers would enjoy to be able to do for a song and Keidis does it all 25 songs. Flea's bass lines are still sick (i.e. Hard to Concentrate), and the drum lines are always cool of course. But these guys have already hit the ceiling of their potential, whereas Frusciante seems to be limitless in his abilities to work magic with a guitar. You can guarantee I'm going to look his name up on the torrent-sphere and download his seven solo CDs that he's supposedly released since the last Red Hot CD. So yeah. Either make me transfer it to you, download it, or most of all, BUY IT. These guys deserve your hard-earned cash. Even if they're gonna blow it on a bunch of useless shit. Dave
