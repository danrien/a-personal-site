# I changed the look.... Oops.

Hey sorry people I decided to go crazy on my bogger here and change the look up. Sometimes, change is good. Hopefully it is here too. Speaking of change.... nevermind. We will talk about that later. Hopefully by tomorrow. I'm off to bed or some strange land. Whichever works best. Oh and by the way. I need to get you people on Ubuntu. PEACe.
