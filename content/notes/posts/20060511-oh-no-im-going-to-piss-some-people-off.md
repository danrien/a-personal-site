# Oh no I'm going to piss some people off...

I was looking at some of my professors' websites just now and I came across an interesting link entitled "Evolution and the Bible" and wanted to take a look at it being that I believe both in G-o-D and EVOlution. You could almost call me an evolutionary creationist. Or a creationary evolutionist. Anyways, enough of me making fun of people and stupid labels. [Here's the link to the article](http://www.ndsu.edu/instruct/grier/evolution.html) and here's a random quote (that may or may not be a good one): 

> The Bible itself does not require that "day" means a 24-hour day. The original word which has been translated into the English "day" is used elsewhere in the Bible in other contexts where it clearly does not mean 24 hours. And 2 Peter 3:8 states (King James), "... one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day."

And now hopefully I've enraged a few friends. Yah fuck you. Just kidding I respect your beliefs it's cool. But this guys smart and you should listen to what he has to say. OUt. PS. I was reading through the quote a little more and noticed that the quote from the bible could be a simplified version of the special theory of relativity... maybe God can warp the fabric of space and time.
