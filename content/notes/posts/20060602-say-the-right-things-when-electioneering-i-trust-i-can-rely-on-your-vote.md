# Say the right things when electioneering, I trust I can rely on your vote.

_Listening to: 'Breath' from 'Rearviewmirror (greatest hits 1991-2003) (Disc 2)' by 'Pearl Jam' on Media Center 11_ Rolling Stone has recently put up an article written by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the 2004 elections. It alleges that the election was stolen from Kerry. Amongst his chief evidence is that the normally extremely accurate exit polls differed so largely from the counted votes. I found it most interesting when Kennedy talks about how in countries where a ruling tyrannical party attempts to mess up votes exit polls are used to keep the those parties honest. In contrast, here in America the exit polls were discarded as "inaccurate", when they're usually with in 1% of accuracy to the actual results. Anyways, it's rather lengthy, but if you're into the reading things, or if you're strongly Republican or Democrat, I suggest you read it. And either you'll get pissed off and call Kennedy a flaming liar and burn down any news stand that carries Rolling Stone or you'll sing the praises of the aforementioned author and proclaim from the highest hill that Republicans are dirty liars. Of course, I side with the latter. After all, if an administration's willing to lie in order to take us to war, then why should we trust them not to tamper with an election in order to stay in power? [The article.](http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen/2) At any rate have a good weekend. Do something about it one way or another if you feel strongly enough. Don't come crying to me though when America's burning down in flames. PEace.
