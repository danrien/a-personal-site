# But you got too much to wear on your sleave...

_Listening to: 'Kissing The Lipless' from 'Chutes Too Narrow' by 'The Shins' on Media Center 11_ I don't know what it is. Part of it is a creeping sensation of depression. Part of it is loneliness. Part of it is something I can't define. Part of it is a struggle to grow up (probably too soon). But one thing is for sure. Right now I am lost in life. I can't even decide what lane to go down when on the road. Another thing is for sure. I fucking hate it. I don't know whether to turn left, turn right or just give the fuck it and park the car and get hammered. Confusion has settled in ladies and gents.... and it isn't good for this kid's poor head. The Man formerly known as Machine.
