# Google's crazy.

[Google Earth for Linux (beta) Released!](http://digg.com/linux_unix/Google_Earth_for_Linux_%28beta%29_Released_#creplyform) If I hadn't said it before, even though Google is quite possibly the antichrist I love the hell out of it. Google Earth on Linux? F yeah. Even if you don't have Linux (guaranteed all of you are using windows), you can still get it..... in fact, it's more guaranteed that there would be a windows version than a Linux version, but I digress. Download it, no matter your OS! Even you happen to be all over the Mac! Machine
