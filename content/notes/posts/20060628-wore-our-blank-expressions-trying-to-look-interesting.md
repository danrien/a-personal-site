# Wore our blank expressions, Trying to look interesting

_Listening to: 'Blame It On The Tetons' from 'Good News For People Who Love Bad News' by 'Modest Mouse' on Media Center 11_ It has been far too long since I've made a meaningful post on this godforsaken site, but today is that day. Maybe not, but I would like it to be that day. If today could be that day, I would be happy. What's been happening? Well, for one I've been making far too much money with the post office. Or not enough, depending on how you look at my bills. But for a kid, it's pretty much been a hell of a lot. Some cool things have happened recently: Billiam finally got his pops to pay me for building their computer, and I found out I have some fucking sweet roommates. And they have some fucking sweet friends. I just payed for a subscription to Eve Online, one of them "Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games". The sweet thing about this is that there are no separate servers (unlike every other one out there), so all 130,000 members can be on at the same time. And it takes place in space. Which is what sold me. No deep thoughts today. Buy computers from DeVeD Computers, my new computer company. You won't be dissapointed. A website I am working on, but I have a phone number for it and all that right now. Anyways. Out. "I met Percy and married her in July But if only to be closer to you, Caroline." â€” Ryan Adams
