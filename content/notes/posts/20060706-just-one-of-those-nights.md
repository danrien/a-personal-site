# Just one of those nights.....

__Tonight, I can't sleep. I thought it was something else at first, but then I realized what it was. Before my first attempt to sleep I had started reading a (political) article in Rolling Stone that had caught my eye. Halfway through it, my roommate came barging into my room and I was distracted. However, around 1:00 AM or so, I just couldn't fall asleep. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I thought I might be going through one of my wierd moods where my mind is really pissed and depressed at the world (a man's form of PMS, but not related to any biological processes other than certain imbalances upset accidentally in the brain), when I came back upon this article. I read the rest of it, and it was bad. Not bad in that it was bad writing, reporting or any of that. Bad in that it was so sad, so confused, so upset that it was just bad for you to read it. The article was of course on Iraq. However, this time Rolling Stone did something a little different than just bitch about the war. They actually sent a reporter into the battle to find if his beliefs were true. The results? Generally the same as most American's thoughts on the whole situation these days: confusion. Nobody knows what to do about terrorism. Nobody knows how to handle Iraq. Nobody even knows how to truly rebound from 9/11. Why do you think Americans have forgotten it so quickly? It wasn't because we're desensitized; in my opinion it's because we were too traumatized. We didn't want that. We were minding our own business before that day, letting terrorists do their little things elsewhere. Then, it happened and it was worse than anyone could've imagined. It shook our foundations. And if there is one thing an American doesn't like, it's his foundations being shook. And so we did the natural thing. We ran from it. Sure, we've pointed some fingers, started some dumb wars. We're confused, and as such, the world is confused, because the world has always depended on us to be the clear minded ones. All I can think of is this: America, it's time to turn this train back around. It's time to confront the terrorists and ask "Why?" Because we would certainly like to know. I want to know. What did I do to you? What did America do to you? We can't help that we're bloated capitalist pigs, that's what happens when a nation gets rich. At least we do what we can to distribute the wealth. In China all the leaders just horde it and make their people work insane hours just to send a paycheck home. We respect your religion, we respect your people. It can't really be about a patch of desert, can it? Can it really be about some place where God supposedly gave birth to human kind? If so, shouldn't we celebrate the ground, open it to all? My suggestions generally really suck, I know, but I can't think of anything else. I just want to know why. Please tell me. David.
