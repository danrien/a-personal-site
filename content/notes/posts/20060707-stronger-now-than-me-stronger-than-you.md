# Stronger now than me, stronger than you

_If life were simple, then it wouldn't be so easy, would it? If it were all just a bunch of jumping through hoops, well then anyone could do that. But success is measured not by our achievements, but by the people we affect. If our achievements happen to do that then that is just a means to that happening. In life, you must ask yourself, do I want quality or quantity? The question is yours for the answering, and which one works for you is entirely dependent on you. Guess you got your work cut out for you, kid. _
