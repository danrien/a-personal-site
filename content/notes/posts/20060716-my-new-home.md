# My New Home.

_Listening to: 'Let It Out' from 'The Reason' by 'Hoobastank' on Media Center 11_ I guess I'm making this the new home of Vedvick's Life. Why? Why confuse you poor people? Because, I need to bring more attention to my business, and as such you poor fans of my writing about my personal life get the added bonus of typing in an extra long url. But don't worry, ye of little faith. You can still suscribe via RSS, and as always you can do a bookmark. And I am sure in a few days this will be the top result on google for Vedvick. Also, you can expect a little more sanitization these days... but that won't mean much considering how personal it has been in the past. Just not all that talk of drinking and partying. Oops. And to potential customers: Of course, please don't judge the business by my personal life. I am very proud of who I am and what I do, and I never regret a decision, except for a decision that affects my future or the lives of those around me negatively. That is why you can expect the best of service from me. That is why I put my life up for display. Because I am proud of it. And I am proud to do what I can to supply you with your needs while doing something I thoroughly, completely enjoy doing.
