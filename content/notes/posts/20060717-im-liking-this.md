# I'm liking this....

_Listening to: '''Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood''' from 'Kill Bill Volume 1' by 'Santa Esmeralda' on Media Center 11_ I've kind of surprised myself, I have to say. I didn't know how much I'd like this WordPress program, but it is really impressive. And it's cool that it is all run by the man behind this keyboard. Within a couple clicks, I can change the them on this site, but I like this simple one so much; it just seems to exemplify my style. And I have no idea what I'm talking about. Anyways, I added a link to my first post ever on BlogSpot. It should be in the column to your right if you want to reminisce about the good ol' days of freshman year here at NDSU. With that I'm out. PEace.
