# Every night it seems like there is no tomorrow, Not that you would ever know

_Listening to: 'Elizabeth, You Were Born To Play That Part' from '29' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11_ I just came back from my favorite memory of all time, Bismarck. I was there for the weekend, and I've decided I love that place too much. I despise it too much as well. The contradictions that take hold in our lives! However, I saw some people I never see, and I also didn't see some people I should see. Because those people mean alot to me. Ah, life. I think it scares me sometimes to know all the shit that's going on out there, without my knowledge or the general knowledge of the world. I got scared like that last night. I also got scared by the powers of temptation, truly the devil's creation or the creator of the devil. If Jesus truly resisted all the temptations passed to him, then his work is to be even more admired, son of god or not. Truly, temptation must be or at least be close to the evilest of all evils, whether it's created by the human mind or something else entirely. The metamorphosis of a desire into a need with the human mind is truly a scary ordeal. Take a look at money. Power. And those are only creations of human society. My advice to all who read this: to truly resist temptations you need to set up all sorts of barriers within your mind to such desires. It's not so much you need to resist, it's that you need to block the desire in the first place. Meditation, prayer, these things can help in the formation of those behaviors. I think. No psychiatrist here, folks. _"Ballroom boogy, just like in the movies"_ David
