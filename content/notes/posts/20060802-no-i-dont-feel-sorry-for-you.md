# No I don't feel sorry for you

[Hey guys.  All apologies for taking so long to post something new on here... just been busy with this damn game _Eve Online_ I guess.  It's so good.  I'm addicted I admit.](http://ryan-adams.com) [ Anything new in my life?  Mmmmm.... not really.  Been bored the past couple days but had an amazing weekend, which I credit to Jordan and Mandy.  Thanks both of you, you both amaze me in your separate yet equally impressive quests to have fun.](http://ryan-adams.com) [Anyways, nothing more to say.  Ryan Adams has a new song on his website.  OMG.  That's what us internet people say.  Ashlee Simpson disgusts me.  Seriously makes me want to puke.](http://ryan-adams.com) [ ](http://ryan-adams.com) [Out. ](http://ryan-adams.com)
