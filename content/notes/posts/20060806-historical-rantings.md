# Historical Rantings

_...from a man who is no historian..._ Tonight I was watching some shows on the Roman and Greek civilizations and the great accomplishments they made, and it occured to me to wonder why these great civilizations with rudimentary beginnings in calculus and mechanical computers could've never discovered things such as electricity.  Imagine, for a moment, if electricity had been utilized by man for not the past one hundred years but rather the past _twenty-five _hundred years.  What miracles could man have accomplished, you must wonder. So, I set about in my mind to figure out why this couldn't be, using all the learnings that our (sometimes) great school systems had given me.  The conclusion I reached was that it must have something to do with the advances society itself had made.  After all, it wasn't until the church had decided to come to grips with Galileo and Newton's discoveries in Calculus that math was able to fast forward to the current state it is in.  These discoveries (and Galileo's revelation that the Earth revolved around the sun, and not the other way around) paved the way for mathematics in electricity.  Moreover, they inspired others to push the scientific boundaries.  It isn't hard for me to imagine that without the Church's grip on science being broken that we might still be in the same state of progress that we were in in the 1600's. This is where I realized that to some extent, the ancient civilizations' worshipping of multiple Gods and strict adherence to these religions had possibly held the civilizations back.  If you could explain everything by something that some God did, then what reason would you have to attempt to explain it another way?  This is my sole explanation for the apparent retarding in those civilizations' advancements to new levels of science and math. Of course, I must also say that if it weren't for the ancients, we would've had to have started out many things from square one.  However, this point may be nearly ignorable since during the Period of Enlightenment we practically did start over as much of the ancient writings had been destroyed in various wars. Well that's all for tonight.  Excuse me if my writing doesn't seem as eloquent as usual, just having a rough time thinking after all that drinking last night... Peace kids.
