# And you'll be where you wanna be

_Listening to: 'When You Wake up Feeling Old' from 'Summer Teeth' by 'Wilco' on Media Center 11_ I just don't know what to say these days.  So many good ideas come to me, but distractions abound. I love you guys and I won't _not_ be back.  You can count on that. Peace.
