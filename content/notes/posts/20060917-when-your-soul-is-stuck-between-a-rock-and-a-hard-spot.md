# When your soul is stuck between a rock and a hard spot.

_Listening to: 'At Least That's What You Said' from 'A Ghost Is Born' by 'Wilco' on Media Center 11_ Why do humans feel the urge to feel miserable?  Why do they seek happiness only to know that it will end in pain?  Sometimes, I feel if a more advanced civilization were to visit us, they would look upon our sick minds with a feeling of incredulity.  It is almost as if we for some reason or the other have to hurt ourselves to feel happiness. It's not as if I'm talking about others now more than I am myself; I've often discovered the quickest route to happiness was one of misery.  I think that in many ways the question above can answer many of history's more horrible stories;  it can also answer many of our many daily questions in life. It appears to me that life is not but a trip from birth to death;  that it isn't much more than a beginning and an end;  if we can somehow overcome the obstacle of our percieved pathways to happiness and realize that happiness is actually found in a few basic things, then I believe we could really achieve what we want to in our lives. Those basic things?  I don't know what they are any better than you, sometimes I think I get an idea but then I realize that those things just make me as miserable as all the others I've tried. As Ryan Adams says, _"Such is life, Such is life"_. _"Were you dead or are you just dreaming you're alive?"_
