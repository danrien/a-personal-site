# Never was a sailor, never was a sailboat

_Listening to: 'Birds Flying Away' from 'Birds Flying Away' by 'Mason Jennings' on Media Center 11_ One time, one of the first times I went to church with my cousin, our priest that day, incidentally enough something like my second cousin, gave a sermon on a person's vocation, or their calling. He said the church long ago defined three types of main vocations: the married life, the single life, and the devout life. I'm not going to go over all these and in fact my post is going to be quite short tonight. To be blunt, _"Why can't I have them all?"_ David. _Is it the soul that is suffering or the mind that is reeling?_
