# Breath all heavy and slow; one shot, one beer, and a kiss before I go

_Listening to: 'A Kiss Before I Go' from 'Jacksonville City Nights' by 'Ryan Adams' on Media Center 11_ Hey guys.  Been awhile, ain' it?  Well I've been busy with this and that, homework and the likes you see.  I been around town a lil' bit, but I usually end up coming down into bed round eleven thirty due to my heavy schedule. I wouldn't say that I don't miss ya folks.  Especially the Grand Forks ones.  Bismarck, you play with my mind, and I love you for it too. And life.  O'er an that, I can't say too much for myself.  Hope you enjoyed the post. _Davie Vedvick_
