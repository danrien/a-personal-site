# Speculations

Today, I began reading a new book, _Atlas Shrugged_. Anyways, life has been rather busy and unstopping lately. I haven't had time for the simple things in life, but I have had the joy of appreciating some of the better things. My life has been filled with all sorts of intrigue and partying and drinking and general lack of sleep; school has found its own way in there in some manner I suppose. Today, I lack any sort of opinion to lay down upon thee, the unsuspecting masses. At least, for today. Except for this; I discovered this while driving back from my allergy shot. It was the realization of my study of the human being, and the question that has been lagging in the back of my mind for a rather long time now, this question being: what is the difference between man and an animal? What does our brain really offer other than becoming an extension of the animal, another tool in his quest to become the dominate species? And the answer is rather simple, and one that has been answered by poets and philosophers throughout all of time I suppose. However, I feel that it should be brought to your attention, to you, my dear reader. It is that we have the choice of whether we choose to be animals, or choose to be something greater. To become absorbed in the wonders that only the human mind can afford us. To become a part of this greater being called society that the discovery of electrons is now allowing us to expand. We are becoming something greater. There is a choice presented to all of us on whether we can become a part of this greater being or live in the docile, normal, perhaps safer environment that we've known all of our lives. This choice is yours, but I offer this advice: to stay in one place, to present constants as a means of preserving some of your perceived sanity, this is all nonsense and you can ignore it. Life has no constants, except for the ones of life and death, and even those are shifting constantly.
