# Sometimes...

_We create our own music._ Mason Jennings was really damn good. That Caroline girl can sing. Life is good, but tragic. 

> _I went to the store today,_ _Didn't feel much anyway._ _Saw the nursery_ _Bought a tree_ _Only to find_ _We lose our time._ **_You don't give up on me,_** **_We are on the win._**

> _Silly straw man_

> _You had a brain but gave it up_

> _Because you liked to go insane._

Life is beautiful. See ya.
