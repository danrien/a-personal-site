# Meanest Man

> _**If the folks next door to me wasn't so good I'd do all the mean things anybody could I'd drink and I'd gamble and I'd louse around I'd be the meanest man in this whole town**_ _**If I hadn't seen the light in that old lady's eyes I'd try to be a man that you would hate and despise I'd rave and I'd rant and I'd scream and yell And I'd chase all my neighbours from here to hell**_ _**If I hadn't heard those kids laugh playing games I'd have nervous fits and I'd go insane I'd turpentine cats and tin can dogs And I'd smother people to death inside of holler logs**_ _**If the people around me wasn't so nice I'd freeze my heart into a cake of ice I'd steal money from soldiers and working folks too I'd lend you a dollar and take back two**_ _**If my wife didn't kiss me the way she does I'd carry four or five daggers and three or four guns I'd shoot craps and ramble and hang out late And I'd steal baby buggies and Cadillac Eights**_ _**If my friends didn't write me those letters I get I'd get to be a dictator and be the worse one yet I'd be the only smart bird and you'd all be fools All I'd send you all away to war and I'd set home and rule**_ _**If it wasn't for them songs I hear all of you sing I'd put a crown on my dome and I'd say I'm your king I'd kidnap some and blackmail others I'd peddle black market stuff and rob sisters and brothers**_ _**If it wasn't for your talking I hear along the street I'd be the oneriest man that you ever did meet I'd preach the gospel of hate and I'd drink your blood But I can't be this bad because my folks are too good**_ _**Words by Woody Guthrie Music by Billy Bragg Words © 2000 by [Woody Guthrie Publications, Inc](http://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Publisher_Contact.htm)**_

That one was for all my buddies and friends and the people I love out there. Seriously, sanity wouldn't be possible without you. Life is good when you got friends.  And of course, Woody Guthrie is the man.  Officially.  Before Bobby D, there was Woodie.  Before him, there was a man named Walt Whitman.  All geniuses.  All worth a listen or a read to.
