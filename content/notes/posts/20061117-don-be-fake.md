# Don' be Fake

Jonathen Wilcox is a man I met on the internet that writes some interesting poetry.Â  We've become pretty good friends because of our alike interests in literature, and here's a poem he sent me (he asked me to put it up). 

> _I wish the real you were here The one that told me darkest secrets with no fear The one that wasn't afraid of me But rather set in glee For all that we could be The one that didn't want me like A greedy woman wants a pet To keep all roun' Jus' for in case all other options were ran out_
