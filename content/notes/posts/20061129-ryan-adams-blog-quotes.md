# Ryan Adam's Blog Quotes

Hey.  I'm sorta drunk and putting up quotes from 'is blog.  'opefully 'e puts up qotes from my b'log.  'Opefully. 'Ere 'hey begin: 

> We are much better when we are building things than when we are tearing them down. Blue like the way girls veins look when you kiss them hard and their skin lays across the grass. This sounds like an after school special about growing up kind of (gross) but what I mean to say is, the thing is big as hell...and growing. It wont happen for like 11nty thousand hundred years or something but eventually it will engulf the planets closest to it and then catch this planet on fire, if it doesn't just go into a blast mode and diffuse all together. _FUCK! Why I am I copying and pasting when I could just be linking?  Answer: I'm a selfish son of a bitch.  Continue:_ 'Cause its getting old seeing people get together based on what they hate or perceive to hate than what they love. We are much better when we are building things than when we are tearing them down. _On Thanksgiving: _Celebrate and support them as though we may have put Wal-Marts on it, this is their spiritual home and we are guests. Draw a circle around yourself and may it be as vast as the universe and the one outside it. And may it all come back to you in the form of a wish.

End of seemingly meaningless quotes _(unless you are drunk or have spent ten years of your life being in such a previously stated condition)_. Anyways, thank Mr. Ryan Adams for that junk.  It is beautiful, ain' it?  And for the record, Mr. David R. Adams, I will love being 20 and 21 and all that shit for you, since you can't anymore. _David Vedvick_ OH and here is a link!   [LINK!!!!
