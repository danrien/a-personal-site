# More life lessons down the pipe

_Listening to: 'Sympathy' from 'Gutterflower Sampler' by 'Goo Goo Dolls' on Media Center 12_ Wow.  This is the first time a revelation has come to me in the form of a dream.  Quite honestly, a lot of things have been pointing to this.  Anyways, my hands are shaky and my arms feel like goo (I just woke up), so I'll make this quick. In life, most social problems will be caused by one distinct, over-arching group, the ones I call _"The Divide and Conquerors."_  How do you identify one of these?  In an argument, they will try to pitch the argument as the audience and the D&C; versus _you_.  They will do this through various nefarious means, such as picking an example you put forth in an effort to _persuade_ the audience that you are right and then picking that example apart and making _the example_ the argument. A prime example of this is the Republican party.  In order to convince Americans that George Bush would be a better president, they pitted the battle as Americans against Kerry want to win the war on terrorism and Americans for Kerry as not caring if they win the war on terrorism.  Now, next time you're talking to your loved ones, which one are you going to choose? How can you battle this?  Well, in case you the D&C; is trying to take you into his fold, the best thing you can do is try to see the poor opponent's point of view.  Try to see if he is making his stand for a good reason, and if he really disagrees with what the D&C; is trying to convince you he disagrees with.  I don't know how to give you any less nebulous instructions; it's sort of a thing you have to feel out. Second part of the battle?  What if you are the one whom the D&C; has taken up arms against?  This one is tougher, and I get the distinct feeling that this is me often.  The best solution I have seen is to convince the people you are losing to the D&C; that you do care about whatever nonsense the D&C; is going on about, and then attempt to bring the conversation back to the real argument.  Or whatever it is. Anyways, this all sounds like a bunch of bullshit.  In my head, it makes complete sense. D&C;'ers: Haters Uniters: Lovers
