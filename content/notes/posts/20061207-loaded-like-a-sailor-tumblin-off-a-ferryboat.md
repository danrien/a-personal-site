# Loaded like a sailor tumblin' off a ferryboat

I was thinking tonight I say some really dumb things.  Sometimes people must just be like_ "I don't know what the hell that Vedvick kid is thinking."_  It's my mouth you know, gets me into all sorts of troubles.  Runs around in front of me like a dog without a leash.  Sometimes, I think it could just use a good ol' kick.  But I'm going to just try to teach it to behave. Anyways, TWO major discoveries today, one in science and one in mathematics. First, NASA has announced that it is very likely that water exists now on the moon, as pictures over the past seven years or so have shown evidence that gullies occasionally pop out of the ground and spew forth their mighty waters, only to evaporate exceedingly quickly in the thin Martian atmosphere.  Must be tough for those green aliens to breathe over there. [Links.](http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/061206_mars_gullies.html) Secondly, it appears as though the age old problem of dividing by zero being impossible and all that has also been solved.  Which is huge, and my understatement as to the discovery of this solution is rather silly.  [I'll just give you a link](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/07/0416223&from=rss).  And you know, that I think about it, all this guy did was give a symbol to something we've known for ages (at least graphically).  I guess somebody just had to have the balls to be like this is what we're gonna do. Yeah, anyways.  Hopefully I don't burn too many bridges in my life with this runaround mouth.  I'll see how it works out.
