# There's no guarantees

God I need sleep. But it evades me, very skillfully at that and my legs have been hurting. Not the hurt that is like ow but you know the annoying kind that makes you want to shoot a baby seal in the face. Or maybe something less cute, but the point comes across all fine and perfect. The pains actually remind me of growing pains, but I think it probably has something to do with my stress level right now. It's a little high. I'm gonna go get some coffee ready for the big test tomorrow morning. You stay cool too I'm sure life will make its own way just as it wants to, and the least we can do is fight it skin and teeth, bones crunchin' to find their own way through these thick murky waters that hold us back.
