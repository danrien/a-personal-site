# The old Irish rose, Drinkin' strawberry wine till it comes out her nose

I just have been really urgin' to use to a quote from _Strawberry Wine_ by Ryan Adams.  And no, it's not that goddamn country song.  Well it is a country song, but it's not the one that that chica sings on the radio like ten or six years ago.  It's original and wonderful and fuck you.  It's also a story.  God it's good.  I wonder if God really wanted to know that.  And I am bullshitting so much right now it's spillin' out my ears and I'm sick of it so I'm gonna quit.  But not because you fools want me to. Love, David
