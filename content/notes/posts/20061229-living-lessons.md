# Living Lessons

I was taking an incredibly intense shower just a while ago and I thought about two more lessons for your life, if you so choose to take them young warrior.Â  In a crack here they are like two young nuggets off the trees of godlines stretching back to infinity. 1\. Expect Nothing 2\. Respect Everything. No explanations tonight maybe later.
