# An addendum

Actually, I take that back. Not all expectations I hate. Just the negative, obvious, after the fact ones, ie _"Why didn't you do better in that game?"_ or _"Well why didn't you work harder?"_ Obviously, if I had been able to I would have done better or worked harder. Or if I had known not doing so would have had those consequences. Or how about, _"You could do so much better..."_ \- yeah I know... couldn't we all? So anyways...
