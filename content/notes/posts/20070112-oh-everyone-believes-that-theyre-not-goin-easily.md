# Oh everyone believes that they're not goin' easily

John fucking Mayer.  I did not think the day would come that I would be listenin to this pop starlet but I tell you what this guy has learned how to rip apart a guitar.  And his lyrics.  Seriously did somebody put something in that guy's water or something you know because it scares the shit out of me when somebody just gets really damn good like that out of nowhere, not that he wasn't good in the first place. It's -13 degrees here I gotta get outside and I am not looking forward to it.  I was all lonely last night so I decided to light up a cigarette and I am fairly certain that was the worst decision of my life.  I'm thinking right now that some people buckle under pressure, others perform admirably and I just kind of slip and slide around until I find some firmer ground.  I know that I hate it when people just kind of expect me to do well at stuff but I like to know that people have faith in me so I'm like a girl or something can't decide what I want and always think that the grass is greener on the other side, it really isn't you know.  That's what that whole phrase is trying to tell you. Anyways if it seems like I'm being really random then it's probably because I am being really random it's 7:09 AM by my count and I've only got one cup of coffee down work starts soon and then school and I'm kind of thinking this semester is going to be rough on me mentally and physically but I'll just work my ass off and see what comes about.
