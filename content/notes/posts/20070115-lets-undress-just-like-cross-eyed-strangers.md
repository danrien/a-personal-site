# Let's undress just like cross-eyed strangers

_Listening to: 'I Am Trying To Break Your Heart' from 'Yankee Hotel Foxtrot' by 'Wilco' on Media Center 12_ So there's a problem with Pink Floyd, which can also be viewed as a merit.  It totally obliterates all sorts of thoughts from your brain, you just don't know what to say when you listen to them.  It puts you in this sort of silly stupor so psycho it'll sends yous offs. Luckily Wilco is back on the playlist so I can think again and think about the place I was just in, no, no drugs were involved, thank god.  Those things are bad and I keep my distance best as I can, every once in a while I hear about another friend who's gone off the deep end or something and that makes me sad, but we all get weak sometimes.  I guess it's all about our will power or something.  Or how we were raised.  Were we raised to deal with things well on our own? That's up to your parents I suppose.  Some parents like to make their kids think that they need them, mine just pushed me out the door and said good luck we'll pay for rent in a couple of years.  They'll also take me back in when it's raining out and make me some lasagna and pay for some of my meals or my gas, but they want me to be independent I guess.  Sooner rather than later.  Hell they somehow sustained three of us little leeches for somewhere around twenty-five plus years that's a good enough my marriage would be strained if I were them.  But they keep on steam rollin' ahead, one of them hardly moves or speaks when he's in the house and the other she can hardly keep her trap shut or stop a moment to appreciate anything.  It's like Woody sez.... umm dammit I can't think of the name of the song but it talks about how opposites always seem to end up with each other and how she came along to him and how women are probably the better sex but we're too dumb to figure it out so we just ignore them anyways. I don't really know where to go from there so I'm gonna stop writing and did you know the Firefox spell checker doesn't mark "gonna"?  Interesting. David
