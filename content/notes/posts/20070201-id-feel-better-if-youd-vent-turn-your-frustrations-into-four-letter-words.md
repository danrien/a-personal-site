# I'd feel better if you'd vent, turn your frustrations into four letter words

My life is like a train these days that just don't stop.  It's like the John Mayer song, _Don't Stop this Train_.  It's like a bus that stops at 3 places a day and holds a steady schedule that won't give me the time of day for myself.  It's like these similes that just won't stop. In fact the only way I am making this post is because I've managed to sneak home long enough to hang out for like an hour.  If you can't tell by my writing all creative spark is gone and I've just turned into another clog in the machine, another brick in the wall.  I even go out drinking and socializing on a schedule and seem to feel like I'm following a set routine or something. Well I shoulda known they'd suck me in someday.  One day the anxiety will end and then I'll miss it but for now I just want to sleep or enjoy life again I don't know if that will ever happen soon, but until then I got music and friends to keep me goin' and that's all that matters.  Hopefully Ryan Adams will be starting a tour in the Midwest for all of us addicts that he's created.  I would call us fans, but that doesn't seem to accurately describe the amount of time we put into listening to his music. You think he knows how much people listen to his shit?  If he did, it'd probably scare the shit out of him. Anyways my brain feels like it's gonna pop but that'll subside when I eat a delicious turkey and ham sandwich straight out of the fridge.  My oven keeps on burning Digiorno's pizzas it's pissin' me off. Peace out
