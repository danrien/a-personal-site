# Ryan Adams is God

Ryan Adams is God. Pure and simple. Well, I mean, there may be a real one floatin' around up there doing his masterful things and whatnot. But any man who replaces the burning fireball of a sun on his frontpage to a rotatin' pizza deserves his place among the gods in my opinion. Just thinking Just a thought you know.
