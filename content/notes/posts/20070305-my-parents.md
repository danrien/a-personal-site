# My parents

I love my parents.  They've done a great job and everything.  But they really come through for me on my birthday.  Anyone who knows about getting birthday cards from me also knows that I generally find the card with the most smart-ass comments, geared just towards them.  Well in the continuing tradition of everyone getting me back, they sent me this amazing card which read: "You're 21!  Party like.... _Well, party like you have been for quite a while, but without the fear of jail time._ **_Love, Mom and Dad_**" What parents.  To their credit, they've done a good job of keeping me out of trouble, through strict rules and lessons and a general instilling of the importance of being a good person.  The only part I have trouble with is being respectable.... hehe Peace out kids.
