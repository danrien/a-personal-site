# Ode to Coffee

OhÂ  great coffee the source

Of all my loves and ambitions

I wish and I wish

And I just don't stop wishing

That if you could stay in me forever

And never ever take a thing out

I would perhaps have some focus

This addled brain with its

Nonsensical thinking and hating and all that

Of really getting an'thing done

Needs you more than you need it.

_Well, except for the greedy bastards_

_Who choose to charge me and suck me in_

_WIth your addictive bullshit._

_One day I will never drink you again_

_And in my grave may that day come._
