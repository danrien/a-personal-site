# My Best Songs

This is part of a poem by Woody Guthrie, titled "My Best Songs": ...And I would fight and die my best, I believe, to fight on the seed that is sprouting, growing, blooming, And fight against the things, plant, animal, human, that try to tell my spirit of life to stop its blossoming, blooming, and its seeding and its planting...
