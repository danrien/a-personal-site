# Can you feel it?  There's a heartbeat missin' in the city.

_Listening to: 'Bridge To Nowhere' from 'Chemical City' by 'Sam Roberts' on Media Center 12_ Something about working out just makes me feel amazing. I think it also makes me into an asshole... heightened levels of testosterone or something of that nature I am sure. Anyways I hit up that bike tonight and it payed off. I don't know why. But I loved it. _ Another day breaks and the last one's gone You dig deep just to carry on Your debt's paid off but it don't feel gone So you slip out the back and you're moving on I can never figure out how to make a case That this don't amount to a fall from grace She wants to know can I replace This tired wool with satin lace She says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast Put it in the past, put it in the past If this is a race then I hope you come last You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast Pressure builds till it breaks the dome You can build a house you can't build a home And it's a fool who believes love is bred in the bone And there's no guarantees that you won't get stoned Yeah, I'm a fool who believed love is bred in the bone And there are no guarantees that I won't get stoned Says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast Put it in the past, put it in the past If this is a race then I hope you come last You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast I don't know where it leads, oh no All I know is that I don't wanna breathe this chemical breeze No more So another day breaks and the last one's gone You dig deep just to carry on Your debt's paid off but it don't feel gone So you slip out the back and you're moving on She says you're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast Put it in the past, put it in the past If this is a race then I hope you come last You're on a bridge to nowhere and you're gettin' there fast_ \- Sam Roberts, "Bridge to Nowhere"
