# Face books

I was surfing the facebooks today, when all of a sudden I glanced at my status and I realized how stupid it was. So I deleted it from the stories and I changed my status. Then I didn't like that one. So off to delete again and making a new one. Then it occured to me that Winston Churchill is a genius: 

> _"For my part, I consider that it will be found much better by all parties to leave the past to history, especially as I propose to write that history myself. "_

And thusly facebook has allowed us all to write our own histories. That whole feed thing was dumb in the first place. And now we just use it to manipulate people's views of us. So has this whole internet thing really benefited us or has it hurt us? All I know is that humans generally forsake privacy in the name of safety and conversely honesty and truth in the name of privacy.
