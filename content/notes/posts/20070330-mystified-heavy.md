# Mystified, Heavy

> _ Ooh, it's got me mystified, heavy now _ _Deep down to my soul _ _You try to keep the wheel steady now _ _Easy as she goes _ _I can hear on the wind a tale that needs to be told again _ _The horizon bends at either end and the sea can't tell a foe from a friend _ _ _ _I know it was only a dream _ _As delicate as a dragonfly wing _ _ _ _I was never satisfied with any life 'til she called my name _ _The air on the high ground was rarefied, every day the same _ _And old fears were always near but when we set sail they disappeared _ _There are those who fear the deep but the world don't wait when your faith won't leap _ _ _ _And I know it was only a dream _ _As delicate as a dragonfly wing _ _ _ _Then we watched as the Southern Cross led the sailors home, constellation borne _ _We set sail in a heavy gale and to the sea many of us thrown _ _And there were times when my courage failed but I never bowed to the storm _ _Whatever path you choose to walk, in the end, you walk alone _ _ _ _Ooh, it's got me mystified heavy now _ _Tongue-tied to the anchor chain _ _You try to keep your hand steady now _ _But it slips again _ _And landfall surprised us all and she broke on the rocks like a china doll _ _You can hear the siren call for the last dance at Poseidon's Ball _ _ _ _I know it was only a dream _ _As delicate a dragonfly wing _ _I hope it was only a dream _ _As delicate as a dragonfly wing _
