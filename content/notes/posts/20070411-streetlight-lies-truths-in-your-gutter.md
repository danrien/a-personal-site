# Streetlight Lies, Truths in yOUr Gutter

_Streetlights glowin_

_In the night-time flowin_

_In the right times showin_

_Their somber thoughts to us_

_Dear I could not be knowin_

_Your thoughts I was needing_

_Your needs I was thinking_

_And the darkness not wanting_

_The need to be new_

_The want to be real_

_The seeds of a seal_

_Undaunted by you_

_Donâ€™t torture donâ€™t waste_

_Donâ€™t think youâ€™re the worsâ€™_

_Donâ€™ think youâ€™re the best_

_Cozâ€™ I never seen you be_

_Tonight under starlight_

_I figured I swiggered_

_A gallen or two for you,_

_MY Dear. For you,_

_My dear._
