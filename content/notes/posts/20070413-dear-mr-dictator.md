# Dear Mr. Dictator.

[This little write-up](http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/04/12/weekly_standard/index.html) is pretty interesting; it's focused on the scary powers Bush has assumed as president.  Certainly, within recent memory no president has had the power he has.  It's a decent read, a little non-conservative for some folks tastes, but hey you gotta do what you gotta do.
