# Easy, Tiger

![](file:///C:/DOCUME%7E1/ADMINI%7E1/LOCALS%7E1/Temp/moz-screenshot.jpg)![Easy Tiger](http://main.losthighwayrecords.com/images/local/toenails/7cae51ab2bfa4b24a48f8a747d60e24b.jpg)So for those of you buried in a hole (or at least not associating with me), you may not know that Ryan Adams is releasing a new CD in June titled _Easy Tiger_. This CD is going to blow the cats away. The reason I'm posting this now is because Lost Highway, Ryan Adams label, has a supposed cover for the CD up on their website. What's funny is that Ryan Adams has become more popular in the past couple years than either him or many others expected. He was going to have a concert at Stonehenge this summer and they had to cancel it due to "unexpected demand." That just seems crazy to me! Four years ago, there was this video of Ryan Adams playing in a bookstore for around twenty or so people. Now he can't perform at places due to concerns for public safety! Also, as a random addendum, I've noticed that I only post on this thing when I'm either a) coffee'd up or b) liquor'd up.Â  That makes all these posts an image of either a little more or a little less of who I actually am, depending on how you prefer me. By the way I fixed a kid's computer problems yesterday and I felt like a f-ing genius. My last fix wasn't much of a fix and it kind of brought down my ego. But I once again feel like a computer god (not to be confused with the real God, who exists in our imaginations and hearts), so thank you very much.
