# Joe Dimaggio's Done it Again

I think the most important axiom when making reference to my life is the "When it rains it pours" one.  It seems like life always seems to either be kicking me in the face or floating me on the clouds.  Either way I suppose that's coz those are the only days worth remembering.  The ones where you feel like shit or the ones where you feel like fifty four million and a quarter just for the sake of it.  Of course it could also be because you landed two jobs in the same day. And by the way who's joining me on Monday for 2 for 1 burgers at B-dubs?  And 2.90 tall domestic beers.... yeh. _Back with that bat,_ _Gone with the wind._ _\- Woody Guthrie_
