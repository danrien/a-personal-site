# Come back down here, I'll show you where it hurts

So I'm just slowly realizing a lot of things.  Such as when I create things original is when I'm at my best.  God I wish I could be that every minute.  Original. _But don't I have to settle for a little bit less,_ _Jus' like the res' of us on Planet Earth_.
