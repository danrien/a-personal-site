# I was walkin'

"When it's after 2 am, just go to bed. Because the decisions you make after 2 am are the wrong decisions." -_ Ted, from How I Met Your Mother_ Words of wisdom from the new coolest show on TV. Move over OC. Anyways, as an example of this, me and my friends went out to the bars last night. And then there was some explosive fight or argument or something and those people ended up fighting I think... I don't know it was after 2 am and I generally, as a rule, don't remember too much after 1:30 am on Friday nights (which is when I usually embarrass myself the most), but obviously _those _people did not make good decisions. And let's not talk about my friends driving.
