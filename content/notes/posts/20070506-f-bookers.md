# F bookers

Hey you fbookers. Welcome to my lil' blog where I write random stuff. I pretend to be pretty damn good at writing so you'll see corny stuff like poetry and dumb stuff like political opinions or lovelorn letters sent out to the masses and sappy shit like that.  And then there are the drunken posts.  Plus the ones where I'm really caffeinated.  Oooo those are fun.  You probably don't wanna read it, but here you are.  Good luck in this tangled mess.
