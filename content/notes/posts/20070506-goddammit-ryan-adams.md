# Goddammit Ryan Adams

Why does that fucker like Europe so much better. So they don't call out for Freebird every 10 minutes. Big deal! Freebird rules, and so do you, and thusly logic leads to one calling out for the song. Come tour in the US big guy. You're hurting my feelings. Things like this make alcoholics. That listen to your music. Dammit you win.
