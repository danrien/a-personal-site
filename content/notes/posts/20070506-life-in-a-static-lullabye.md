# Life in a static lullabye

I've been attempting this studying all day and I just don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing.  Mostly, it's a matter of focus.  I try to drink coffee to draw the mind in but I'm just completely lost on this last section of CSCI 161.  Graphs and what not.  You gotta wonder what these guys were thinking when they came up with this shit. Also, I'm thinking posting this blog on Facebook could hinder the writing process for me... this amount of pressure doesn't always bode too well for my ventures.  Everybody just needs to chill out and it will go cool. Anyways peace out.  To the world.
