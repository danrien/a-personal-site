# We're the places that we wanted to go

_Listening to: 'People As Places As People' from 'We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank' by 'Modest Mouse' on Media Center 12_ I've noticed an interesting trend in the rate of my blog posting:  generally, I pick up my blogging rhythm sometime in the spring, when I'm cooped up because of school but desperately looking for something to do _other_ than school. Then, in the summer my blogging drops off and my blog's status drops to near-death. On comes the fall, with all of it's depressing nonsense.  Here, I start to post more often to my blog, but it becomes about depressing shit; then I decide that all this blogging is ridiculous and I decide to start stopping that.  Moving on to January, after the finals, after the flaming wreck® known as my life finally starts to get put out by the damp snows of Fargo mid-winter, I start to realize that I can maybe really pull this whole scam off. Back to spring, and here I am writing three posts a day.  Maybe summer school will change that, but I doubt it. David
