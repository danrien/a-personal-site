# Until tomorrow, I'll wear this crooked crown

I've been itchin' to write on this thing for a day or two so I thought I'd swing by and say hello. Finals going good. Good things happening. It's always such a damn process, but good things do come out of hard work. And having a little bit of fun. Sidestreet tonight anyone? Thought I would add some cool lyrics from the song "Sailing Seas" by Abandoned Pools: _ Damn this destiny And damn this twist of fate And damn its 5 A.M. and I'm still awake_ You really have to hear the song.
