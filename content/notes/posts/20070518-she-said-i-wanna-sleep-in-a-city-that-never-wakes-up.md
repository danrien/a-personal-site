# She said I wanna sleep in a city that never wakes up

Hey guys.  My life has been pretty crazy lately.  It started out last week Tuesday, but it tore on until this Wednesday.  Frankly, I'm surprised I wasn't dropped off at St. John's psychiatric hospital in Fargo due to the amount of alcohol I've consumed in the past week. However, medical concerns have taken precedent over my drinking needs, and thus I have been forced to at least temporarily stop my ten day bender.  I'm even thinking that maybe I don't feel like drinking this weekend. So what are these medical concerns?  Well, it would be nice for you to know I'm sure.  Rest assured, it only has something to do with my mouth and some teeth that are growing in.  Apparently you aren't supposed to drink after having wisdom teeth removed.  Shocking.  I would of figured that it would have helped the pain. Anyways, I'm not really an alcoholic.  Plus, there's no way I'm going to do any of that stuff this summer what with nobody being there. Peace out fools.  That was mean.  You people aren't fools.  Peace out guys.  Love and peace.  All that stuff.
