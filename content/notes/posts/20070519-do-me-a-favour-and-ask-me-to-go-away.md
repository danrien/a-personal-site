# Do me a favour, and ask me to go away

![Favourite Worst Nightmare](http://www.ucsdguardian.org/articles/2007/0503/hiatus1001.jpg)Some song lyrics for you guys. This is off the new Arctic Monkeys CD. It's phenomenal. Originally, I was gonna put the lyrics up here to a song called "Do Me a Favour", and I assume it's about breaking up or something. It seems pretty wretched and sick and only the Arctic Monkeys could've written lyrics like this. However, I decided that was a little too dramatic and boring for my tastes, so I thought I'd put up this other song, "If You Were There, Beware", which is kinda cooler and more relevant to the whole college experience.....? 

> _If you were there, beware The serpent soul pinchers Three hundred and fifty no thank yous and nobody flinches Go on girl go on, give us something gruesome We require your grief, the thugs help the thieves As they're trying to rob the words from her gob and Take the source of the innocents_ _If you were there, beware The serpent soul pinchers Can't you sense she was never meant To fill column inches And you've had enough, what you're trying to dig up Isn't there to be dug, the thieves help the thugs As they're trying beat the good grace of a sweetheart_ _Out to the point she'll comply_ _Why leave her on her own If I'd have known then I wouldn't have said it I wouldn't have said it if I would have known Why leave her on her own If I predicted tears then I wouldn't have said it I wouldn't have said it if I would have known_ _There's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are Our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far I don't know what it is that they want I don't know what it is that they want But I haven't got it to give She hasn't got it to give_
