# Are you pulling her from a burning building, or only throwing her to the sharks

In the manner of the autobiographical approach that my blog has taken recently, I have decided to post a little bit about the going-ons of my life recently. I had my wisdom teeth removed.  Covered in previous post.  Moving on, the pain hasn't been too terrible.  Everybody seems to be real freaked out by the whole operation but on a whole I think I have walked away from it relatively unscathed, besides a few third molars missing.  Who needs 'em these days anyways, right? I have been playing a lot of Marvel Ultimate Alliance on that 360 Box X or something whatever its called its like alien technology we hooked it up to my parents 40 inch LCD it was frickin' cool.  We (the collective I like to call "the swimmers") have also been putting in a ton of time into watching 24 season 2, as my most recent Facebook wall posts would highlight.  Also, I've started using that T9 text recognition thing with my phone for texting recently really makes the whole process a lot easier. That's my life mostly in a nutshell.  Still holed up in Bismarck.  I try to call people when I'm here but it's nearly impossible to see everyone.  And I hate feeling guilty for not calling people so just chalk it up to my ineptitude at operating a cellphone and we should all feel okay about.  Plus I think I'm starting to develop a fear of phones.  Like the whole calling a person over the phone just holds a certain stigma to it.  It's like who can call first.  And whoever calls first is the weaker person.  Strange.  It's like that episode in Pete and Pete.  Which my roommate is getting the DVDs for.
