# "Old Yellow Bricks" by the Arctic Monkeys

I love these British bastards. Especially when they say "Dorothy" like "Door-ah-thee" Lyrics go as so: 

> _Old yellow bricks, Love's a risk, Quite the little Escapoligist Looked so miffed, When you wished, For a thousand places better than this,_ _You are the fugitive, But you dont know what you're runnin from, You cant kid us, And you couldnt trick anyone, Houdini, love you dont know what you're runnin away from,_ _Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up? Blinded by nostalgia, Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?_ _She wasnt raised by the way, That the emperor put traps in the cage, And the days she being dull, Lead to nights readin beer bottles,_ _You're such a fugitive, But you dont know what you're runnin from, You cant kid us, And you couldnt trick anyone, Houdini, love you dont know what you're runnin away from,_ _Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up? Blinded by nostalgia, Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?_ _You're at a loss, Just because, It wasnt all that you thought it was,_ _You are a fugitive but you dont know what you're runnin away from,_ _She said I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up,_ _ And revel in nostalgia,_ _ I know I said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up but,_ _ Dorothy was right though_
