# You may be a victim of software counterfeiting.

Thanks assholes. F-ing Microsoft. Thanks alot. Psh. Anyways. Sitting. Here. In my apartment. I don't know. I think my life is like resetting or something. All I know is that a lot of things piss me off these days... a lot of things make me kinda depressed... and I still have a lot to be grateful for. We all do no matter how much we lose.Â  Not that I've really lost too much... maybe some pride or something over time. It really just bothers me when people think everything is always hunky dory in David Vedvick land. It's okay - I still love you people.
