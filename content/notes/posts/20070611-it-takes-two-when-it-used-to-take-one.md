# It takes two when it used to take one

Well Ryan Adams has finally, finally done it.  He's actually released a CD that normal people will like.  Fucking bastard.  But in the end, good for him.  It's really good and I'll still love it to death it's not the kind of pop sensation that Weezer's _Make Believe_ was, which really just kind of pissed me off.  Hey Rivers why don't you just turn your emotions off and make a billion dollars.  Yeah that's real cool. Anyways, I'll try to get two of the tracks that are available for public consumption streaming up here (I hope I'm not breaking loads of copyright rules by doing this), interspersed between my own ramblings on the machine we call the guitar.  I'm sure the difference in quality will be negligible. Anyways Peace out. David E. Vedvick PS Did you notice I've been changing the store's front page a little bit?  Yeah it's slow going but what do you expect when all I have to do here is nothing.  Hopefully it ends up looking good though and I can get some real products.  Quality Control is something else I'm working on.... a couple of my past builds have had some reliability issues.
