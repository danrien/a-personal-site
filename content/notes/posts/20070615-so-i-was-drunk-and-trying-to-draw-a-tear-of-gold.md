# So I was drunk and trying to draw a tear of gold....

And all I could draw was a nude woman with lyrics from new Ryan Adams' stuff.  By the way, I was driving people round tonight.  And I played the song that I know is gonna be famous of 'is and the first thing they said after the song was over was "Who is this again?"  and you know what? That's a good sign.  Especially when they're saying "I've 'eard this before". ![weareonlyonepushfromthenest.png](http://devedcomputers.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/weareonlyonepushfromthenest.thumbnail.png)
