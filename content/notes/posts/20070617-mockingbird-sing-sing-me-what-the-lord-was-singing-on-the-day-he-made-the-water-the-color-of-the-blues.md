# Mockingbird sing, sing me what the Lord was singing on the day he made the water the color of the blues

Wow well I guess I get to see like my fucking idol in under 24 hours.Â  Right now I'm napping but in 24 hours I'll probably be on cloud nine or in Cloud City or somewhere round that. _Sing me that song, sing me till the heaven's rising, on the day he made the water the color of my baby's eyes. _
