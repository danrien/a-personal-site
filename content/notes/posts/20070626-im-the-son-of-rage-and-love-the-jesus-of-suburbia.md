# I'm the son of rage and love;  The Jesus of Suburbia

I'm having one of those days where I seem to be incessantly in a good mood, no matter how much I screw up the day or try to get depressed.  It rocks.  But really how good is Green Day?  American Idiot is like pop genius.  Especially in the fact that it is a satirical expose on the American way of life.  Which most pop kids never got.  Which makes it even gooder.
