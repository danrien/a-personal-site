# SCammeers

He called himself by no name, but the brochure said "I Commerce."  After a little Googlin, I find out it's owned by this little company, named [Quixtar](http://www.quixtarwiki.com/index.php?title=QI).  Yah and my buddy told me it's not a pyramid scheme.  All this damn dude could talk about was training.  Training training training sell shit blah blah blah. Oh and if these guys from Success Express come by offering to sell you some magazines for like 60 bucks, forget about it.  It's more damn scammers.
