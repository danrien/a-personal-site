# Catch Hell Blues or "When you get these feelings, next time, be sure you're gonna tear someone apart."

This post is a long time in the making. Simply put, walking away is sometimes the only thing you can do. You can kill yourself inside by trying to keep something alive, but you're just beating the dead horse. Or you can take the moments when something was alive, and crystalize that into your memory, keeping the good parts alive, eliminating the bad, and just moving on. Simply put, walking is sometimes the only thing to do. _Only problem is when the dead horse likes to twitch just to remind you that it was alive once._ Don't get me wrong; I love horses. In fact, I think I fell in love with a horse once, accidentally, fleetingly, sadly. But anyways, we all should be where we wanna be in life. Leave the horse behind those twitches are just death throes. If it comes back to life it will only be because it's a robot. Nobody likes robot horses. Unless they breathe fire, in which case they are almost like robot dragons or robot sex slaves. Robot typewriters with robot spacebars. And this whole thing was a giant metaphor wrapped in cliches, in case you were not paying attention like your mother told you to. Except for the robot part.
