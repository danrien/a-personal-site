# Heart attack when in doubt; bump along till the truth comes out

_Listening to: 'Wish You Well' from 'Tea & Sympathy' by 'Bernard Fanning' on Media Center 12_ I got these contacts but I tell you what my right eye is tweaking me hard core.  I can barely make out this screen from the times I need to see it. Anyways I'm doing some good stuff these days sometimes I'm still slipping into that me that didn't have much confidence; it's interesting when you live an entire four months of your life living like everything's okay when it wasn't, but you trucked through it anyways to avoid more pain than had already been caused.  But I'm really enjoying people and life right now.  I find most people hilarious, course I figure I'm the most hilarious looking of 'em all, sittin' round bars hanging out making a good time if I can.  Not saying yes when a cigarette's been handed to me.  Hopefully Sidestreet can hire me.
