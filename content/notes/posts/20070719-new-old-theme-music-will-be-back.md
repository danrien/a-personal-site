# New (old?) Theme, music will be back

I've been playing around with Wordpress a lot lately and have been messing with the theme mash up etc., and so the music and what not is non existent for right now but don't you folks worry it will all be back in good time.  On a side note, I've gotten rid of the tracks from the new Ryan Adams CD, mostly because I've listened to them so much, and put up some calming music.   I figured if somebody's gonna visit my site, then they might as well get on my wave level. Anyways, promise to God and Allah and whatever mono- or polytheistic god(s) you choose to worship, this shit will come together in no time lickity split. Better believe it.  Now I have to go build some circuits.
