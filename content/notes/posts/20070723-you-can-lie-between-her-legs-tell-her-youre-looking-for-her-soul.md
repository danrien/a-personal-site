# You can lie between her legs, tell her you're looking for her soul

_Listening to: 'Sing Me Spanish Techno' from 'Twin Cinema' by 'The New Pornographers' on Media Center 12 _ Mondays rock for me.  I don't know what it is about them but I always like them.  It must be my anti-conformist take on the whole life deal. Anyways, I wish I was at Jimmy Eat World (JEW) right now - but I'll get to see them at a decent concert someday hopefully. At any rate, I didn't necessarily fail my Circuits 2 test, didn't get fired, got my dual core processor in today, and got to see 30 seconds of _"Kill"_ by JEW from a message from my buddy's phone.  And I got to read Harry Potter.  A lot of it.  And I haven't really eaten today yet but I'm working on it.  Anyways they filled me up in Bismarck to the bursting point anyways. Beer.
