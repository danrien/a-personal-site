# She's got eyes pretty as a pair of jewels, falling down a canyon like a couple drunken criminals

I could quote Ryan Adams all day.  The only reason I don't is because it's all too good.  Anyways.  I realized Jordan is like a zombie or evil robot when drunk he just goes for the closest fuel source and digs in.  When I woke up on Friday (after accidentally skipping my morning classes) I discovered that not only had the buns been hacked into but the bread was also cracked.  And the fucker didn't even bother to untie it or anything just a straight-on ripping open of the bread and grabbing. Of course when I'm drunk I just pass out anywhere I can manage to curl up so I'm not too much better. But damn does Sidestreet rule.  But what's up with cross-eyed girls asking for pot?  They're all so fucking strange.  Women, I mean. _"Kissed me on the lips but my heart just slept it off,_ _Words may move, but they never move fast enough."_ Excerpt from "_English Girls"_ by Ryan Adams
