# Creepy Moral Dilemmas Make BioShock a Sophisticated Shooter

[Creepy Moral Dilemmas Make BioShock a Sophisticated Shooter](http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2007/08/bioshock_review) I _really_ want to play this game. I mean _really_. Problem is, my computer doesn't have the juice to play it. It's _really_ bumming me out. This game is making waves so big it's gonna topple over the Statue of Liberty (why are all our great monuments - sans Mount Rushmore - over water?). Games like this, games that capture and capitulate you into a different world, they're one of the few types of games worth playing. Somehow, somewhere, I need to build a new computer. Or buy a 360. But a computer would be better. Higher resolution. I need to make some money. Have sex for money. Something. I don't know but I've played a bit of the demo. The whole Randian theme seems pretty crazy. I know some fans of Rand who would instantly recognize the world you're thrown in. One where there are no Gods or Kings, only the creations of man? And apparently the game makes you think, which is crazy. It brings up some pretty hardcore moral questions about that type of society, which is also part of the reason I want to play it. And one of these days I will start reading _Atlas Shrugged_ again. I just don't know when.
