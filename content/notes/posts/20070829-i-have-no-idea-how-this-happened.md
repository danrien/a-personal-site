# I have no idea how this happened

SO I WAS GETTING UNDRESSED AND NAKED FOR THE SHOWER AND I realized that I must look like a stuck up pretentious prick sometimes.  I think it stems from the fact that I'm a naturally really good teacher while simultaneously being a very independent-minded learner who has a hard time learning from _anybody_.  Thus, I can teach a person, but they must notice when I seem to ignore them when they try to teach me.  Blame it on the genes baby.
