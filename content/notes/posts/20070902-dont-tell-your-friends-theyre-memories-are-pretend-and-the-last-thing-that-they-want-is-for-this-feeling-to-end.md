# Don't tell your friends they're memories are pretend and the last thing that they want is for this feeling to end

_Listening to: 'This House Is A Circus' from 'Favourite Worst Nightmare' by 'Arctic Monkeys' on Media Center 12_ This is my obligatory hung over night after post.  Damn got drunk last night.  My life seems to be pulling together bits and pieces more and more I'm liking it despite my best efforts to destroy these advances. The lead singer of the Arctic Monkeys has to be one of the greatest singer songwriters of our generation. I'm thinking tonight I'll either read some Randian prose (_Atlas Shrugged_) or watch _Last of the Mohicans_.  Either way, I'm going to drink some water.  Probably have some Coke.  Just to pick me up. _I'll put a spell on you_ _And when I wake you_ _I'll be the first thing you'll see._
