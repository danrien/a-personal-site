# Entering hour 7 or 8 or something around there

of my Electronics homework.  Anyways I was scoping out the rocky hilly landscape that happens to be my desk while simultaneously attempting to read an article on _The Inquirer_ and trying to figure out what the hell "n" is in a reverse saturation power diode with a reverse saturation of 10 to the negative 8 and I discovered a little bottle cap and I said to myself "hmmm I wonder what this could be still doing on here..." figuring that it was probably just one of the multitude of things of trash I keep stored on my desk (for I would never want them to have a place in the garbage, where most people keep such objects) when much to my surprise I discovered that it was a "Buy one Get ONE free" cap.  In the words of my alien leader Howard Dean, "_Yeeeeeeeah!_"  Why he never turned that from an embarrassment into a catch phrase is beyond me. I figure a few more cups of coffee and this homework might not make anymore sense than it does now but I'll at least have stuff down on the paper. _Peace out you foul floundering fiddle-playing fools._
