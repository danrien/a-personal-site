# Ran across this one this morning while doing Electronics

"_Houses on the Hill_" by Ryan Adams _Well I found a bunch of letters That were written for the fellow who broke your mommas heart And the envelope folds smelled of her ancient perfume I'll bet she didnt know How to respond before the blankets of snow Caught him out wandering alone With no place to go_ _There were stars in the sky There were houses on the hill And there bottles of pills that were easy to buy To keep her warm from the oncoming storm_ _Well I found them in the northwest corner of the attic in a box Labeled tinsel and lights Didnt know what I was I looking for Maybe just a blanket or artifacts Eisenhower sent him to war He kept her picture in his pocket that was closest to his heart And when he hit shore Must have been a target for the gunman_ _There were stars in the sky There were bunkers on the hill and there were caskets to fill Where he will lie Shrouded in the red white and blue with the stripes_ _There were stars in the sky There were houses on the hill And there were bottles of pills that were easy to buy To keep her warm from the oncoming storm_
