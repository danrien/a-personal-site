# So many little babies stuck without a home

If there is anything truer about growing up, then this stanza out of _"Remember the Mountain Bed"_ by Woody Guthrie would sum it up: 

> _ I learned the reason why man must work and how to dream big dreams To conquer time and space and fight the rivers and the seas I stand here filled with my emptiness now and look at city and land And I know why farms and cities are built by hot, warm, nervous hands_
