# COKE

I think Coke might not be good for the thought processes.  It is something about these sodas, there lethal injections of high levels of sugars mixed with (relatively) low levels of caffeine that seems to have this perverse effect on the human mind. However, taken separately from coffee it seems to act just fine.  However, don't be surprised if you find yourself come down with a come down shortly after ingesting this black liquid.  The sugar kicks your heart into high gear than drops it down, waiting for the caffeine to get into action.  Of course, since caffeine generally takes longer to take effect the more you take it (as any coffee drinker will tell you), after you have been an avid coke/Mountain Dew drinker for a long period the "gap" between the immediate sugar high and the later caffeine rise begins to grow, leaving you in a major down period, and then leaving you in a state where you are unable to think but are able to think quite clearly. Thus, the first hour or two after drinking a coke sucks, but after that, you should be able to perform mental tasks at a higher rate than before (hopefully). Oh well oh well here I was doing Electronics again.  Seeing that test is going to be horribly depressing, I know.
