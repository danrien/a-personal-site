# Jimmy Eat World - Carry You

_ And I know I'm all alone Say your name slowly And I know that I'm alone But I'll carry you Does it feel good like a memory When you try some history It's a dream to come around But who doesn't then, Because the taste doesn't taste the same again It's easy feeling righteous when you're new All you'll get is what you wanna hear It hurts because it should How else am I to make it clear? I could never be the one that you want, don't ask. Well, here's to living in the moment 'Cause it passed. Maybe your life is what I need sometimes You took the most and best of anyone You said to "keep me in your pocket" So I carried you You better choose your words carefully Because I'm not your anything Gonna stay here in my place And you'll stay in yours because Your only good is what you're good for I pace around the room to spend the time Waiting while the burning pictures fade Want a thing to make you mine And another to say it's fine I could never be the one that you want, don't ask. Well, here's to living in the moment 'Cause it passed, it passed. I'm still carrying a little hope that Maybe things could get different now Is that so wrong, is that so wrong, is that so wrong? Would I see you tonight At a place we go? I wanna make things right Before time runs out. Roll down the windows Let the cold air come in, Slap my face just to feel, to feel you there again I could never be the one that you want, don't ask. Well, here's to living in the moment 'Cause it passed. I could never be the one that you want, don't ask. Yeah, here's to living in the moment 'Cause it passed. 'Cause it passed, it passed, it passed_ Good thing that this guy still knows how to write lyrics.
