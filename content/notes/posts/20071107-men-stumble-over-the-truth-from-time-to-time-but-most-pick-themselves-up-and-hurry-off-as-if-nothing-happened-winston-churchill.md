# Men stumble over the truth from time to time, but most pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing happened - Winston Churchill

I think I remembered today why I don't really drink anymore.Â  Anyways my boy Ryan Adams who I stopped listening to for a month (in order to exact my personal revenge for him leaving after 70 minutes at the Minni show) is releasing a _boxed_ <strike>set</strike> and is making another two CDs. And _Follow the Lights_ is amazing but the right channel on my headphones went out so I can't listen to it while walking now and my right eye is having an emotional break down cause I didn't take the contact out for like four days or a week so I might be crying a little bit today.
