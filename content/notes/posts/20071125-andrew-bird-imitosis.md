# Andrew Bird - Imitosis

Okay - I don't know if these lyrics are right - but this seems about right.  Anyways.  Amazing song.  I'm planning something big for you blog readers in the next few weeks or something right now it has started out as a little nugget of an idea as soon as I get done doing homework and studying and get sometime to not freak out (that never happens never anymore unless I have a few drinks to slow down the ol' brain). _ He's keeping busy Yeah he's bleeding stones With his machinations and his palindromes It was anything but hear the voice Anything but hear the voice It was anything but hear the voice That says that we're all basically alone Poor Professor Pynchon had only good intentions When he put his Bunsen burners all away And turning to a playground in a Petri dish Where single cells would swing their fists At anything that looks like easy prey In this nature show that rages every day It was then he heard his intuition say We were all basically alone And despite what all his studies had shown That what's mistaken for closeness Is just a case of mitosis And why do some show no mercy While others are painfully shy Tell me doctor can you quantify He just wants to know the reason why The reason why Why do they congregate in groups of four Scatter like a billion spores And let the wind just carry them away How can kids be so mean Our famous doctor tried to glean As he went home at the end of the day In this nature show that rages every day It was then he heard his intuition say We were all basically alone Despite what all his studies had shown That what's mistaken for closeness Is just a case of mitosis Sure fatal doses of malcontent through osmosis And why do some show no mercy While others are painfully shy Tell me doctor, can you quantify The reason why?_ Anyways time for work.
