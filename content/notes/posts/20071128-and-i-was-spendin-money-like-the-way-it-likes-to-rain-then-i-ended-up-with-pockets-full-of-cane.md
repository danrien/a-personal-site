# And I was spendin' money, like the way it likes to rain; Then I ended up with pockets full of cane

I don't know what it is, but ever since I updated my site this morning I've just been itching to post on here.  Maybe it's just the snow.  Maybe it's the beer.  Maybe it's the fact that every time I look at the electronics book I want to get the hell out of here.  But I would much rather be doing this than that.  That's Electronics for you, always making you want to do something else.
