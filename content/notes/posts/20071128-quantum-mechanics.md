# Quantum Mechanics?

This morning during Electromagnetics I was pondering the world of the electron and the way in which it operates in that world, and I was wondering if perhaps it was best to think of the electron as existing in a 2-dimensional world, where it is effected by an "unseen" 3rd dimension, much as we live in a 3-dimensional world and are effected by the "unseen" 4th dimension, time. Of course, electrons are also effected by time, but it seems much more logical to think that they are effected by that force through actions carried out in the third dimension. I then began to extrapolate this line of thought to most particles in our universe that don't have a thinking mind. It seems that most of them move in the two dimensional space and are effected by some force that comes from a third-dimension. Then, I started to wonder why if this is the way it is, why nobody has said that before. So then I figured I'm probably full of shit, but just in case I'm not, I thought what if I took this further, and moved to the elementary particles inside electrons, protons, and neutrons. You know, the quarks and such. What if they move in a one-dimensional space, and are effected by "unseen" dimensions, and that is why they act so strangely? Then I started thinking, okay, well we are effected by the unseen fourth dimension, so what if some sort of being or entity could see the fourth dimension? Would this be the "God" that we are looking for? Would he then have to be effected by a _fifth_ dimension? Can he effect us through time, and that is why he takes on such exuberant and mystifying qualities? Anyways, I've never taken a quantum mechanics course and most of what I've learned about this stuff is from PBS shows and the like, so I can't really lend much validity to my thoughts, and that's all they are anyways, just thoughts.
