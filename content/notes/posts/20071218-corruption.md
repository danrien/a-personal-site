# Corruption

If _Animal Farm_ should teach you one thing, it is that corruption occurs at every level of power - and that the true challenge in life is to avoid becoming the corrupted - to avoid becoming the pig.  This is mildly tied into greed, and is in fact a result of greed and that insatiable human hunger for more. But to be a true human, one must overcome their hunger and strive to improve the others around them.  The human race has made it this far not on sloppy competition to see who can attain more, but rather on cooperation to better itself above its animal origins.
