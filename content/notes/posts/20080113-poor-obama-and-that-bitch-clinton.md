# Poor Obama - and that bitch Clinton

> _ Ha_ _ I gotta tell ya_ _ I'll make it better_ _ But i know there's somethin' i needed to say_ _ When i was out, though_ _ Maybe you were better alone_ _ I know i'll make it home_ _ She told me sweet thang_ _ Run a labour_ _ In your shoes_ _ Touch me til i follow in love_ _ I wanna help her_ _ Maybe we were better alone_ _ I wanna show you how_ _ And then we walked out_ _ Make it ? now_ _ I said i want it but i never alone_ _ I wanna show you_ _ Maybe we were somethin' uncool_ _ I wanna make you sing_ _ Uh uh oh_ _ Uh uh oh_ _ Uh uh oh_
