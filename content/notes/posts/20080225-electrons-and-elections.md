# Electrons and Elections

A very cool, first ever video of an electron has now been made. You can see it [here](http://www.atto.fysik.lth.se/video/emovie.avi). Also, next week is the make or break week for Clinton, so if you are in Texas or Ohio and don't want that bitch to win, throw him a vote of support. I'm sure I'll talk to you all later, _David _
