# The campaign

As I watch the Obama - Clinton campaign reach its (slightly overdue) climax, I wonder why it seems that I am in a scene similar to _Animal Farm_, where the more intelligent, better speaking politician (pig, for that's what they all are) is about to be chased away by the dumber, more manipulative politician (still a pig, if you're wondering) with her dangerous hounds that she's raised from birth.
