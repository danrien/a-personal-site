# Obama

If Obama continues this downward spiral I'm seeing of his political values, then I might have to change my vote to "no one." C'mon Obama, do the good thing and rise above the masses like you always do.Â  Of course, the danger of losing with this strategy is dangerous (to be redundant) and must be taken into account, but as long as Obama can win the nomination of the Democratic elders and keep his integrity intact, then he can still count on me to vote for him.
