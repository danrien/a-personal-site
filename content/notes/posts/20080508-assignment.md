# Assignment

I want everybody to do something:  take a look at your female friend's facebook profile pictures.  An interesting observation will be made.  Girls make their profile pictures into whatever they love:  themselves, their boyfriends or their friends, or perhaps the rare one who loves nothing.  It's quite strange and funny.  Hopefully you'll take a look at this.  As a guy I found it extremely entertaining.  Hopefully none of my female friends are reading this or else you'll maybe hate me from now on.
