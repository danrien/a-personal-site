# The Job

Well folks, it's now two and a half weeks into my job at [Emerson Process Management,](http://www.emersonprocess.com/home/) and I'm happy to say I am really enjoying it. To say that they are one of the greatest companies I've worked for so far would be a massive understatement. The friendliness of everybody is a little.... well, surprising to say the least. Perhaps it is just because of my inexperience in the professional world or my jaded experiences with past employers, but the management here from the top on down is top notch, and my coworkers are some of the nicest, friendliest people I have ever met (management included). I surely have much more to learn and much more to do, and a lot more adjusting to this world - perhaps mixing in a little more humility now that the joy of good grades and the novelty of this great job with this great company has worn off.
