# Shade

Some characters are registering themselves on my website with lil' botting programs or whatever (if you're actually registering, then just let me know - but generally I don't consider @mail.ru addresses to be genuine) and are probably responsible for the weird way my blog is acting.  Anyways, no matter.  The posts on the left give you the most recent blog posts. And the most likely culprit is probably my hosting provider.... they just recently upgraded my server.  Faags.
