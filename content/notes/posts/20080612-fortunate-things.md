# Fortunate things

This whole blog being read backwards from oldest to newest post right now is kind of cool I think.  At first it pissed me off, but reading some of my older posts, I really got an appreciation for the way I used to write.... honestly.  I guess age and life undo some of that for you, and it's all a struggle to come back to that Utopian idea of honesty and righteousness and all that. I missed a meeting at work today..... hopefully I don't end up getting in trouble for it.  Stupid Outlook forgets to remind me of stuff.  If Outlook can't remember, then how the hell am I supposed to?  Anyways, gonna get some coffee for the mornings so I don't mess up every day like I did today (yes I need coffee to pull off getting to work 'on time'....)
