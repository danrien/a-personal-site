# Gas, Oil, and everything about it.

I figure that these rising oil price stories have reached such a ridiculous climax that it's finally time for me to make a comment: Let the oil companies raise their prices.  People will respond like they always do and find ways to not spend money on oil.  That's why we call it laissez faire.... ( or however you spell it ) In the end, if you want to save a buck, buy a bike and ride it.  Put on your shoes and walk.  Hop on a bus.  A train.  A plane.  This period of individuality that frankly started in the era of Bill Clinton has reached its final and tragic end, and it is time for us to come back together and be the socialites we always have been.  Humans work better together and transportation is no exception to that rule.
