# Thoughts and thoughts and thoughts and thoughts and thoughts and thoughts and....

Lately, I've been a little disappointed in Obama.  For a man who has stood for so much good in this world, he sure did screw up his reasons for rejecting "public" funding.  I think it would have been much better for him to just come out and say that he was turning down public funding due to the fact that his public supporters were willing to give him much more instead.  Of course, he could've wrapped in the idea that the public funding is pretty dated and seems to leave plenty of loopholes for 527s..... if this had been the case, then I would have approved much more of his comments on rejecting public funding. _Atlas Shrugged_ has been an interesting read.  So far, Rearden has had to give up the woman he loves to accept the deeds that he has unknowingly done.  The book is mostly interesting in that it paints a very clear, good picture of what I also believe a person should be.  However, as a social system, some of Ayn Rand's thoughts seem to be a little naive and lack the expansive perspective that is required to understand a socio-economic system.  A nation survives simply because it is a nation - individuality and nationhood are two things that are in constant battle.   A person survives by his wits, but when he pulls together with others, and helps those whom serve him a purpose, he stands the chance to wreak massive, good change upon a system. In essence, I'm trying to explain that Ayn Rand's belief that individuality is the key to all the problems facing the world is a little short sighted.  Individuality and the need to interact with and help others are two concepts that are constantly in battle, and should be.  They are the keys to building a successful world, and one cannot live without the other.  Anybody who dips into either pool of thought too much (socialism or individualism) risks losing sight of the big picture and of their purpose here. For a good perspective on a how a socio-economic platform should be built, I would recommend the _Dune_ series.  Without spoiling too much, the basic premise of the series is that constant, persistent _change_ and _growth_ are what a people need more than anything.  Through constant battling,bickering and struggling, a social system comes together.  When everything moves too smoothly (although I profess I don't know what is too smoothly or not too smoothly, I only ask that you trust your instincts), then the system is being controlled.  When it comes to halt, then nothing changes or grows and the system becomes stagnant. I know, I know.  Contradictory animals, aren't we?

**[David Vedvick](#1258 "2008-06-28 18:45:19"):** As an added thought, I would also like to append to the contradictory animals comment that it is through our constant struggle to not be contradictory that good things are wrought.
