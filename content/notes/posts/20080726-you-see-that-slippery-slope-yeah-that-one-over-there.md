# You see that slippery slope?  Yeah, that one over there....

While the (insane) coverage of my candidate has been exciting, it has raised some concerns in my mind.  As a progressive, I'm alway interested in the fairest of battles.  But if somebody's gonna win, they're going to win.  And to attempt to somehow give the loser an advantage to even the game is just as unfair as giving the winner an advantage to ensure he does win.  If that sounds rather confusing, read it again and again until you get it.  Fairness goes both ways folks, and it applies to the winners and the losers. I guess the real point of fairness isn't to force the winner to give away his victory, but rather to make sure that that victory wasn't engineered or ensured through some external means, and it was accomplished by himself.  I think that would make Ayn Rand and Frank Herbert proud. \- david
