# Contrived

That's a little contrived Ayn Rand.  You could've done a little better work with the English language than that.  In fact, the entire book is a little contrived, but I'll give it to her since her cause is good.  But there's nothing wrong with making your audience probe a _little_ bit for the answer.   That's what makes it fun.  Don't give away the good stuff right away... make them wait for it - as your characters do.
