# Congratulations Barack

Well my boy just did something amazing.  Wow.  I hope he wins so I can see his inaugration speech. Well on part 2 of my thesis on Ayn Rand: The reason this ties into "Congratulations Barack" is very simple, and so I'll keep it very short.  Basically, Barack said "_Individual Responsibility_ and _Social Responsibility_, that is what makes America great."  The idea that life is not one way or another, that you aren't either concerned about only yourself or so concerned about others that you don't care about yourself, is very important to my concept of how humanity should "work."  One thing that does bother me is when he said "putting your neighbors ahead of yourself." Personally, I believe you _should be concerned about yourself_ first, and others second (preferrably the people you care about most next).  Because caring for others more than yourself chains you to them, ties you down to _their_ needs and wants - which takes away from the ability of you to operate of your own free will. Overall though, I agree with Barack 95% of the way.  But I cannot stress how important it is to care about your own well-being first.  Then, worry about the others around you.  For if you can make money off of them by giving them a few pennies to get a good education and get a good job and make that money, then it pays off.  If I were to critique and change Barack's words, I would say: _"Individual Greed_ and _Social Invigoration"_. David BTW His civil libertarian moments of the speech were incredibly spot-on.
