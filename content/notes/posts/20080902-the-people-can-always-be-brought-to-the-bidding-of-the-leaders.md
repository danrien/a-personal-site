# The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders

I found this quote that Jesse Ventura of all people brought up on Nightline about politicians and leaders whom lead their citizens unwillingly into war: 

> Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the _leaders_ of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ...voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country. - Hermann GÃ¶ring

Striking similarities between the present administration's politics, ain't it? Thanks, David
