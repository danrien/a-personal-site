# Puke

Nothing makes me want to puke more than watching a stuck-up Republican lost in their own success seemingly viewing the world through some alternate reality.  Of course, if I saw a Democrat of the same nature, I would feel the same way.  In fact, I do - the way the Clintons have acted since probably 1998 and the way even someone like Biden (occasionally - just when he's standing around; when he talks, all doubts melt away). acts reminds of this sort of self-righteous, thy-art-better-than-thou makes-me-wanna-gag-in-my-mouth feeling. But that's just how I feel about someone like Cindy McCain after watching her talk.  It's like watching one of those PTA women that shows like Weeds, The OC, and Donnie Darko (movie, but you get the context) make fun of.  It really is pretty hilarious.
