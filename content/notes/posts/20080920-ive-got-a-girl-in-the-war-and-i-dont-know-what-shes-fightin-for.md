# I've got a girl in the war and I don't know what she's fightin' for

Man Josh Ritter kicks ass.  Weez kicks ass. DR. Adams, you kick ass as always above all ... it's just so accepted that I forget to mention it.  I'm going to watch Paris, Texas so I can figure out why my current obsession, _Travis_, chose to name their band after a character in the movie.  And I'm going to find more useful things blog about.... perhaps some commentary on the financing crisis occurring.  You think in 80 years they'll look back at this crash of the US financial system and say to themselves _"WTF?"_ kind of like we do with the 1930's banking crisis.
