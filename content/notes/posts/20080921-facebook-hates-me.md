# Facebook hates me.

Facebook hates me, so I'm going to just [post this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/20/AR2008092001059.html?hpid=opinionsbox1) here.  It's a good idea of what we should have really done with the economy.  If you are for free markets at all, then you'll love this.
