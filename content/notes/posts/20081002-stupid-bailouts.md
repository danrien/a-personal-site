# Stupid bailouts.

While I am all for governmental programs related to education, national defense, and providing the bare minimum to survive for mothers with four kids hangin out, I get really bothered when people get "bailed out" by the government for making bad decisions regarding OTHER people's MONEY.  Indeed, I'm bothered anytime somebody files bankruptcy.  It's basically, in my mind, admitting that you weren't responsible enough to keep track of your stuff.  Anyways, the article: http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/10/kill_the_bailout.html
