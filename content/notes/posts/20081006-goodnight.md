# Goodnight.

I'm sleeping my butt off.  Gettin water in meh.  Doin Tylonel PM>  Going back to work.  When I get the chance.  Should I add my boss to my Facebook?  Would be kind of awkward... maybe I'll put him on the "Limited" Profile.  Sorry if the stuff is messed up my desk is a mess and its kind of all in between the kyboard and the receiver. WEEZER  WOW RAY LAMONTAGNE DAMN I THINK I CRIED I ALMOST DID AT LEAST DR ADAMS>  I REALLY ALMOST DID CRY I FELT BAD sometimes songs like _La Cienega_ bring up some sad memories.  Good sad ones that make me want to cry and remind me of what I did and what sacrifices I made to get my world together. OH yeah.  What a corrupt government douchebag we got in that paulson idiot huh?  I hate that guy.
