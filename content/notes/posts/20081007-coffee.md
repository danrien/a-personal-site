# COFFEE

Also (tambien in Spanish), coffee is GOOD.  But it makes you unsleepy (not needing of sleep) when you are needing to sleep, so you can work tomorrow.  BAD.  Where's the balance in this life?  Why can't the day just extend to fit my needs perfectly?  Oh well, the world ain't perfect and I ain't gettin perfect anytime soon either.  SO peace out .
