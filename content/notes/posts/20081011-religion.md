# rELIGION

I am utterly convinced that God made pizza and coffee and that in response the Devil (always being the more nefarious type and hatin on God's cool stuff) made booze and pretzels.  This doesn't mean that we can't use the Devil's creations for good (i.e. having a fun time with some buddies and gals every once in a while) - just as God's creations can be used for bad.  Enjoy.
