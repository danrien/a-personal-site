# Dear DR Adams

Dear DR Adams, I hope you read my blog and find it really boring and super critical of everyone.  You are my personal hero.   I realize, this is not something you like.  Deal (with it, the "Deal" thing is something I picked up from this person I hung out with a few random times this summer).  I read the FOG/FUZZ and thoroughly enjoy both (or rather, will, when the FOG comes back online). Love, DEVeds PS RDP is fun. PSS At least Pete Doherty isn't my hero :S.
