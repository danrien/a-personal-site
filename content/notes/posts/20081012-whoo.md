# Whoo

I think the markets have finally stabilized.  No thanks to those idiots in Washington.  Unless I've been missing something (which with my OCDish following of politics and markets seems unlikely), it seems as if Paulson and his cronies have done _nothing_ except save their own skins.  Maybe I have some fundamental flaw in my understanding, or I just don't understand.  Nah. Anyways.  I think we've hit bottom.  Everyone's so depressed, that spending is bound to be more conservative, smarter, etc.  Which means good things. However, let me make this clear:  it's easy to fall off the proverbial cliff.  Climbing back up to the top is the slow, hard part.
