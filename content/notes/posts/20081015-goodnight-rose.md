# Goodnight Rose...

If _Cold Roses_ was the hatching of the Cardinals, then these birds now know how to fly.Â  Listening to the Cardinals show I went to, I now think these birds are more like some super-hybrid between a Cardinal and a phoenix, able to rise from any death and resurrect and fly again. In other words, they've found _it_.
