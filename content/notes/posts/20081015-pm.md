# PM

So                     I Watched the end of the debate.   A little scary.  I seriously thought McCain was going to rip somebody's head off.  But I just went to Old Chicago, enjoyed their Halloween Kick-OFF party.  Work tomorrow.  Work my ass off.  Can I say 60 hours in any easy way.  Can I say I like to work any other way. OKay I haven't even said it other than the way I said it.  Tylenol PM is settling in - (which means) sleep, not awake til 5 am coz I drank all my coffee CRAP.  New RA'nC (RANK if you want to say it in English). Hate hate hate girls so annoying I don't know why my mind explodes whenever I try to understand their ways... I just see things from others' points of views too easily so I don't get pissed off like your standard human will do - but I just get _annoyed_.  _Frustrated_.  And ultimately, the _d_ word.  I won't say it coz I said it before and it isn't a nice word.  Not in that sense.  Maybe in the sense that of how I feel when I eat chinese food, it's an okay word.  Anger always comes later I guess - testosterone is still pumpin through my veins, I can't help that.
