# CARDINOLOGY

WOW.  This CD rocks.  I know I know it's not out yet - I know God hates me for downloading this.  But I couldn't help myself when I heard it was out on the torrent stream up in the clouds.  Sometimes ideas like _Cardinology_ can't be held back by things such as record labels. PS I am going to buy it.  You should too.  Download at your own risk though. I'm having a terrible sinus attack today.  MAN. Nose feels like somebody shoved 10 lb weights up them.  Searching for Sudafed..................
