# ETERNAL DARKNESS

I'm playing _Eternal Darkness_ right now.  It's fucking crazy.  The graphics were way ahead of their time. This chick in this game is hot. Facebook is crazy.  I love life.  Hopefully I can keep on chilling with all this overworking of my brain/body from work.  I'll try to keep myself _chill_.  That's how I like it.
