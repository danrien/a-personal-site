# You have no fear of the underdog, that's why you will not survive!

Hey.  At work.  Looking for bugs that have been fixed, to verify that they have _indeed_ been fixed.  Sounds kind of redundant, and it is, and that's the point.  Having as many people verify that something works as expected is the best way to release a good product.  In business, I have learned, redundancy is king.  Some financial experts could use that kind of advice, eh? I've fallen in love with Spoon, the band, not the utensil.  Figures that I had to move on from Travis (the band, not the person) at one point.  The Cardinals (the band, not the birds, although Cardinals with lasers coming out of their talons always kick ass) will always be there though.  I can't stay stuck on some fools for no reason, I have to grow and find more to like, that's just what I do.  Growing.  Changing, but staying the same.  You might bite an apple one way or another, but the core is always the same.  And yes, that metaphor makes absolutely no sense.
