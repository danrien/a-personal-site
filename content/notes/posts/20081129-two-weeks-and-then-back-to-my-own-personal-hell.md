# Two weeks and then back to my own personal hell

But that's alright, I'll cope as I always have.  I'll do lots of sleeping and lots of homeworking and maybe finish up my secret lil' programming project (boy is it coming along nicely).  I love laptops.  I love RDP (Remote Desktop Connection).  SO GENIUs.
