# Someone that I met, that I hardly knew

Alright my brain is having an explosion.  I was confronted with a complete contradiction last night and my mind cannot calculate the meaning of all this. So here's how it goes: A friend of mine (co-worker) decided to ask this individual that we were talking to give a tatooed guy a hug.  For $20.  Needless to say, you ask me, I'll try to give this tattooed "tough guy" a hug for free.  Just coz it's fun.  However, I wasn't asked to do this, so I did not. So the individual agrees to the bet, and proceeds to walk up to aforementioned "tough guy".  He talks to "tough guy" for a while, then gives him a hug.  This all seems rather anticlimactic to me (and very unscary) but I let it happen without saying a word.  Co-worker gives him the dosh.  Nice. So I am wandering around being drunken me, which is sort of a lot like sober me (unless it happens to be a night where somebody hooks me up with RockStar, then things get crazy), and I notice this individual walks back  up to the "tough guy" and gives him ALL TWENTY DOLLARS.   Needless to say, such lack of logic or making sense sent me into complete shock.  My drunken self couldn't handle the lack of logic and I had to start calling me people to make sense of it.  It didn't work.    RRrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  I hate it when things don't make sense.
