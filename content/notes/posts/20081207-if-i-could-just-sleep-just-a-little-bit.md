# If I could just sleep... just a little bit....

I've been listening to Rachael Yamagata's new CD today.  MAN is it awesome.  Really sad.  She should take some prozac or something or maybe just make a CD and write a song about it or something.  JEeZ. And that title's misleading if you come from the world where sleep is hard to come by.  Rather, I just can't not sleep.  Unless I have 12 cups of coffee in me.  Then I'm a programming machine, and I don't even write on here.  See ya later.
