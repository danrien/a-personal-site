# writing writing writing

Bored.  Bored as a cat.  That's why i hate cats.  They're always so damn bored.  It's like do something already, cat.  Dogs are way better.  They can't help themselves.  They've got to do something or else they're doing nothing.  In a previous life, I was a hindu and I was a dog.  Now I'm christian though, so I gotta choose between heaven or hell.  Damn.  LIfe ain't simple, huh?
