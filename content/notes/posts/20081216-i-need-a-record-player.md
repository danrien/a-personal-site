# I NEED A RECORD PLAYER

Listening to _Cold Roses_ on a record player was something similar to a religious experience or sex so it would be great.  Thanks. Also, my fingertips are going crazy they hurt like mad.  I guess that's what I get for pushing my car bare-handed in -10 degree weather.  IDIOT>
