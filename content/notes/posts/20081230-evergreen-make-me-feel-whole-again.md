# Evergreen, make me feel whole again

Man what a sweet christmas vacation I have had.  I got two really sweet gifts from my parents, that are going to help my PC be really (badass), and I got Barack Obama's first book, _Dreams From My Father_, which is super awesome.  I've gotten some good programming work done on my project, and I've almost beaten _Super Paper Mario_ for the Wii.  I love my life.  My mom has been making this awesome turkey, it makes me so happy when I eat it and makes me hungrier than I was before I started eating because it' s that good.  I've been to Aberdeen, partied it up with my boys. Still enjoying _Cardinology_, but I got to tell you, Spoon's newest CD _Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga_ has blown me away.   Man anyways I'm boring right now, real boring.  No caffeine in me, I guess. Pretty cool how I see a lot of good things happening in the world these days, and I can't attribute much of it to me, I guess, but I'd like to think that I've done my part and done the best I can.  There are some terrible things happening, and there always will be, but it ain't as bad as it used to be.  Sometimes just having a man with good intentions at the helm can change things for the better. Anyways, it's so dry these days that my nose is runny and my eyes watery.  I'm hungry a little bit, so I'm thinking I need to do some eating. See everyone later, or sooner, I suppose.
