# Battle Star Galactica

_"There must be some way out of here," said the joker to the thief,_ _"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief._ _Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,_ _None of them along the line know what any of it is worth."_ _"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke,_ _"There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke._ _But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,_ _So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."_ _ _ _All along the watchtower, princes kept the view_ _While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too._ _Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,_ _Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl._ \- Bob Dylan
