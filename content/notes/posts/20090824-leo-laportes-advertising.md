# Leo Laporte's Advertising

is slightly annoying. Â It's an innovative way to advertise, but I can only imagine he tells the guys when before the show starts _"You better talk good about my ads or else you're never getting invited back."_ He's a good show host, is generally very up to date on technology and web stuff, so I'll listen to him.
