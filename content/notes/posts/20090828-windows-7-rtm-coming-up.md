# Windows 7 RTM Coming Up

NDSU has had the kind heart to loan me a Windows 7 key for personal use.  Hopefully it turns out.  I'll try to get back to everyone on the quality of Windows 7 here in a bit. A few words though, before the installation occurs.  I'm currently using Windows 7 RC (Release Candidate), and I can say that it is rock-hard stable.  The only place, in my mind, that the Release to Manufacturer's release has is to go up. In other news, I'm listening to _'Abel'_ by The National, and it's awesome.
