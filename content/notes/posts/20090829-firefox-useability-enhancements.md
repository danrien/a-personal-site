# Firefox Useability Enhancements

So we've all been enchanted by the simplicity and usability of Google Chrome, correct?  Well, if you haven't, then I highly recommend downloading it. However, overall  I prefer many of the features of Firefox, and even some of the UI decisions of the open source browser, so I prefer to use it for my everyday browsing needs.  Even so, I find myself missing Google's Aero Glass integration and such.  So I decided to look for ways to integrate some of these with Firefox's add-on support.  Here's my list of what I added to make Firefox more usable by today's standards: 

  1. ## Firefox "Windows 7 Remix" theme:

I installed [this theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/13579) that emulates the proposed Firefox 3.7 "Windows 7 Remix" theme perfectly.  You also have to install the [All-Glass Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/12181) Add-on, which allows Firefox to use the Glass effect present in Windows Vista and 7.  Makes browsing look much nicer.

  2. ## Personal Menu

[This plug-in](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3895/) lets you get rid of that space-consuming menu-bar and replace it with a few IE7/8/Chrome-ish buttons.  On top of that, you can even edit the personal menu and add your own menu  items from the aforementioned traditional menu-bar to it.

  3. ## Speed Dial

[Speed Dial ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4810)has been around for awhile.  Basically allows you to have a similar Speed dial page to the one in Opera show when you open a new tab.  Useful, similar in concept to the bookmarks bar.

  4. ## Tabs Open Relative

The final Chrome-inspired add-on that I added was the simple "Tabs Open Relative".  All it does is make links that open a new tab open the tab directly to the right of the originating tab.  Find it [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1956).

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="609" caption="Tab Preview Add-on"]![Tab Preview Add-on](http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/tabpreview/tabpreview.png)[/caption] 

Feeling a little inspired by Win7 I was when I was searching for an Aero Peek-ish add-on that would show my current Firefox tabs in the Aero Peek tabs in Windows 7.  Well I couldn't find any add-ons, but this[ tab preview add-on](http://ted.mielczarek.org/code/mozilla/tabpreview/) helps out, at least.\

  5. ## A tip

I would also like to add a tip this list to give you _even more_ browsing space: get rid of that worthless status bar at the bottom of the browser.  Just go to 'View' in the menu-bar and uncheck "Status Bar".

## The Final Look:
