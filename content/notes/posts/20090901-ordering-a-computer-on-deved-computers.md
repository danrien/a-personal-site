# Ordering a Computer on DeVed Computers

As some of you know, I've recently created an application for DeVed Computers ([found here](http://www.devedcomputers.com/store/CreateOrder.php)), that allows you to either pick from a computer created ahead of time or to create your own.  I've had this up for a couple of weeks, and have since kinda taken a break from all DeVed Computers related stuff (except for building and troubleshooting/repair computers, of course).  While I have tried to make this web app as self-explanatory as possible, it is probably still helpful for some to see a tutorial straight from the creator, so here goes: 

## Step 1:  Pick needs that reflect what you want to do with this computer

In this step, you check the boxes for things you want to do with your computer.  While I've tried to add as many needs for a computer as possible, there's a very good chance I haven't added them all yet - if you think of one, contact me at contact@devedcomputers.com and let me know.

## Step 2:  Enter a Budget for your PC

In this step, you set a top limit on what you want to spend on a new PC.  If there are existing orders in the DeVed Computers COSAS Database that reflect your  needs, they'll only show if they're under or equal to the budget you set (nifty, huh?)!

## Step 3:  Buy a PC that's already been ordered from DeVed Computers or Create your Own

** 

Here, you can select a similar PC to yours that was previously ordered from a user whom had selected needs and a budget at your level or lower, if you wish.  If you choose to do that, proceed to Finishing ordering your computer below.

Otherwise, go ahead and click the 'create your own PC' link below the pre-configured PCs, and proceed on to the next step!

## Step 4:  Select a case

So now that you've chosen to create your own PC, the web-app has found some cases that fit your needs.  If you move your mouse over the item, you will see the item description and the price of the case.  After selecting your case, go ahead and click the 'next' arrow.

## Step 5-10(ish):  Configuration

Complete the rest of the steps - don't worry, the app figures out the compatible items for your computer, so just pick the items that fit your budget and with the features you want.

## Step 11: Finalizing your order

Now please take a moment to review your order.  If you see an item you don't want, or decide you want to change something, just go ahead and click on an item to change it!

## Step 12:  Link your order to a username

Now you can go ahead and link your order to a username.  Don't worry, I don't ask for a name or address, this is just so I know who ordered that fancy computer.  Name and address get asked for later by PayPal (who has secure storage for your credit card information).

## Last Step:  Add your computer to the PayPal Cart

This last button leads you to the PayPal cart.  From there, PayPal will take care of you.

## The Last Last Step:

Finally, if your payment goes through, your parts will be assembled and your customized PC will be shipped to you in under 3 weeks!
