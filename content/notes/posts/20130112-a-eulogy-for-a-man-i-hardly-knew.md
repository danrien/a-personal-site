# A eulogy for a man I didn't ever know...

Today it has been reported that Aaron Swartz has committed suicide. I never really knew who the guy was, but his credentials were amazing, and I think this is one of those things where you don't realize what your world (my world consisting mostly of technology) had until you have lost that asset. Aaron Swartz was an incredible mind; he developed the early version of Reddit, he was a co-author of the original RSS 1.0 feed (which my blog and every blog uses), he helped develop a _L__egal_ document (Creative Commons 1.0), and he had released tons of scientific data to the public. He committed suicide today, and we now will never know what else he could have contributed to our world, and to mine in particular.
