# The new deliciouspc.com (the site formerly known as DevedComputers)

I have "officially" launched my new computer business website, delicious pc. It's currently in a bit of a rough state, but I was so pleased with how everything was coming together that I couldn't help myself and so I published it to deliciouspc.com. Here's a little run through of the site: The homepage: ![homepage](http://davidvedvick.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/homepage-300x159.jpg)   Selecting needs:

Inputting your budget:

You're already done. Wasn't that easy? ![email](http://davidvedvick.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/email-300x159.png)             I'm sure there are some parts that won't work (I just discovered the e-mail option isn't working at the moment), but overall it seems to be in a decent alpha stage. UPDATE: I just got the e-mail option working again. Back to android development soon!
