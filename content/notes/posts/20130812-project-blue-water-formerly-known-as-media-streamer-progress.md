# "Project Blue Water" - formerly known as "Media Streamer" progress

Major improvements have begun to the UI of my media streamer project for J. River Media Center, which I'm now giving the name "Project Blue Water". First and foremost is the "Now Playing" UI, for which I've taken some new screenshots, to be loved or hated: !["Loading" Now playing screen](http://davidvedvick.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/loading_img-576x1024.png)   !["Inactive" Now Playing screen](http://davidvedvick.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/device-2013-08-12-075712-576x1024.png)   !["Active" Now Playing screen](http://davidvedvick.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/device-2013-08-12-075734-576x1024.png) As you can see, I've also added the ability to change the rating on a song!
