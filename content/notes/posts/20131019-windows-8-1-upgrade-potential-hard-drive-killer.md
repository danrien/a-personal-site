# Windows 8.1 Upgrade - potential hard drive killer?

Upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 has already taken two victims. Will it take more? Word of warning to those upgrading their Windows installs to Windows 8.1 this weekend - I installed it on my (7-year old) 250GB RAID 1 array and it thrashed and killed both drives. So lookout! Obviously it being an older pair of drives, I can't speak to the reliability of them, but it does seem very odd that they would _both_ suffer from SMART errors on the same day. Otherwise, on my other machine Windows 8.1 seems to be working fine.
