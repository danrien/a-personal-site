# Stop using my documents folder

Game developers, please stop using my "Documents" folder to preserve the state of your video games. This is annoying at best and worst case, destructive. Here's my random list of why: 

  * It eats up space on an area that I might have specifically set-up to not use space (since it is only supposed to be _documents_ and all)
  * There's a better place for preserving the state of a program in Windows; it's under <user name>/_AppData_/... notice the "AppData" in the folder path?
  * It adds unnecessary data and/or configuration steps when I synchronize my personal, you know _documents_
  * Like the above point, it requires extra configuration in a back-up tool that I may use for backing up my documents to exclude your information 
    * And don't think that just because I am playing your game, I care to back-up the game data! 
      * And if I do, and I already know how to use a back-up service, I will configure it do that myself!
  * It puts a bunch of folders in _my_ documents folder referencing gaming companies. I don't see you putting your video games in my filing cabinet, WHY IN THE HELL IS IT IN MY DOCUMENTS FOLDER?!
  * Finally, usually the data isn't even frickin' documents! Take a look at Sid Meier's Civilization 5:

Do you think a _cache_ is something I would store in my documents, Sid?
