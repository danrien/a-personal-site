# Clearstream, the project formerly known as blue water

It's a new year, so I have some new screenshots of Clearstream, the project I used to call "project blue water". I'm closing in on the final feature set for Clearstream before I release it to the public - only one item left on my list: Last.fm support. [gallery ids="1340,1339,1338"]
