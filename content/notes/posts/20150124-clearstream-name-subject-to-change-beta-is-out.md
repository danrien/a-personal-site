# Clearstream (name subject to change) Beta is out!

I'm proud to announce that Clearstream is ready for a beta release. I initially will be providing it as a download that you will have to install manually. It currently only supports Android 4.0.3+. I also plan a release of the source on GitHub or some other Git hosting service at some point soon. It's a fairly straightforward app that is intended only for streaming _music_ from [J. River Media Center](http://www.jriver.com/index.html). It's main goals are improved streaming reliability and better usability. I intend to write at least a crappy attempt at a tutorial for using it, but until (or if) that happens, you can look up [previous posts](/category/coding/music-streamer/) to get a hint of how to use it. The main UI "trick" that users will need to be aware of is that many list items will show a menu if they are long pressed. Update: Please use the [most recent version of audiocanoe](/2015/05/24/news/audiocanoe-the-alternative-android-audio-streaming-client-formerly-known-as-clearstream/).
