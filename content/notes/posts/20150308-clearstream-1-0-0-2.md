# Clearstream 1.0.0.2

Hey everyone, I've released a new version of Clearstream, Clearstream 1.0.0.2.
Feature-wise, it's the same as the previous release (I will likely bump the minor
version number up if I add a new feature). This is still what I would consider
a beta release, but the code has reached a point where I'm comfortable releasing
the code to the general public.

First, the download

Update: Please use the
[most recent version of audiocanoe](/2015/05/24/news/audiocanoe-the-alternative-android-audio-streaming-client-formerly-known-as-clearstream/).

[To the code](https://github.com/danrien/projectBlueWater): Clearstream code will
be released under the Lesser General Public License
([LGPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License)) 3.0,
meaning you can fork the code and change what you want, but any derivative works
must be released under the LGPL or a more restrictive license (such as the GPL).
Further, if you use parts of the code as a library (for whatever reason you would
want to do that?), you can use it in software with any license, as long as you give
me credit! [I'd suggest you post any issues here.](https://github.com/danrien/projectBlueWater/issues)
