# Clearstream 1.0.0.3

Hey everyone! ClearstreamÂ 1.0.0.3 is out! I mostly focused on making the UI consistent across the board. No doubt there are some areas that are still inconsistent however. Here's a list of the fixes/changes: 

  * Search activity filters on audio file type
  * Pressing "back" button when a context menu is open reverts context menu to list item first
  * Clicking on an item in a context menu reverts the context menu to the list item first
  * Clicking on a file no longer plays it
  * Added small tutorial
Download here: Update: Please use the [most recent version of audiocanoe](/2015/05/24/news/audiocanoe-the-alternative-android-audio-streaming-client-formerly-known-as-clearstream/). If you've never installed a third-party app before, there's very many good tutorials to set you up. [Here's one.](http://pocketpccentral.net/help/android/general/app_install_android4.htm)
